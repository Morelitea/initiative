"""TTRPG-themed dev data seeder for Initiative.

Usage:
    python seed_dev_data.py          # Create test data
    python seed_dev_data.py --clean  # Remove seeded test data

Designed to run from the backend/ directory (CWD) so app imports resolve.
Saves created IDs to .vscode/.dev_seed_ids.json. The dataset itself lives in
``scripts/seed/``, one module per area; this file runs them in order.

Creates 3 communities with multiple users, initiatives, projects, tasks, documents,
tags, and comments to exercise all features of the app, plus six small communities
that exist to fill the community directory (which this switches on). Communities 1
and 2 stay invite-only so the unlisted case is still there to look at.

Seeded logins (all password "changeme"):
- admin1..admin4@example.com — dedicated community admins (platform tier: member).
- user1..user8@example.com — regular community members only (never community admins);
  several are initiative PMs so PM full access is testable from a non-admin.
- owner@/operator@/moderator@/support@/member@example.com — one user per
  platform tier, plus seeded PAM access-grant rows (pending / live / denied /
  expired / break-glass) to exercise the privileged-access flows.
- superadmin@example.com — the community compliance seat, held in EVERY seeded
  community (platform tier: member, so the community seat is testable on its
  own rather than alongside a platform tier).

Every community also seeds template projects and archived projects (with a spread of
archive dates, tags, and tasks) so the Templates and Archive tabs have the same
variety the active list does.

Sharing variety: resources cover every share status — private (owner-only),
per-user read/write grants, initiative-role grants, and all-initiative-members
"general access" rows at both Viewer (read) and Editor (write) levels.
