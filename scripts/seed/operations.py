"""The operations community: where this deployment's own security,
moderation, support and feedback work lands, set up with the platform ladder
seated in it.

The ladder is a set of accounts with nowhere of their own to work until this
exists, which is what made every intake surface unreachable on a fresh dev
database. So it is seeded as an ordinary community with the ladder mapped onto
community roles: the platform owner holds the seat (as its creator), the
operator administers it, and everybody else is a member. Both halves are set
up, because either one missing leaves the streams unreachable: the
deployment's pointer (``app_settings.operations_guild_id``) and a binding per
stream, each from its committed blueprint the way the operator's own "set this
up for me" does.

A stream that keeps an initiative to itself (security, moderation) gets one
of its own, with only the people who would work it in it; the rest share the
Operations initiative.
