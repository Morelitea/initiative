"""Board notices: pins that lapse, polls open and closed, receipts, a draft,
and one that goes on reporting a task's column through a live chip.

Dates are spread back across the year on purpose: a board with everything
written today has nothing for the timeline rail to scrub through.

#: Each notice. ``paragraphs`` is a plain body; ``parts`` is one paragraph of

#: people in ``shared_with`` only); ``read_by`` never counts the author. A
#: poll's ``votes`` are option indexes by voter.
