"""The community directory, and the small communities that exist to fill it.

Communities 1 and 2 stay invite-only, so the unlisted case is still there to
look at: no categories, no 18+ answer, no card. Community 3 is listed, which
puts one community with real content behind a card — the superuser is already
in it, so it shows the already-a-member state next to the joinable ones.

#: Enough to be a believable card — a name, a description, artwork, its
#: shelves, and a roster whose size shows on it — and enough behind the card
#: to be worth arriving at. The first initiative is everybody's; only the
#: admin is in the second, so everyone else meets it the way a visitor does,
#: and the two carry different join policies so "Join" and "Request to join"
#: are both reachable. One community auto-joins its arrivals. The music shelf
#: is deliberately left empty, so "nothing on this shelf" is reachable too.
