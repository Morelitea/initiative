#: Each wiki, shared with the initiative for reading; the display settings

#: and ``template`` the one new pages are copied from.

#: A page is an ``intro`` then ``sections`` under their own headings — the
#: contents list in the sidebar is built from those; a section is one
#: paragraph or a list of them. ``links``
#: close the page as a "See also": ``"Vallaki"`` is a page of the same wiki,
#: ``"Other wiki::Vallaki"`` a page of another, and ``("task", title)`` any
