"""A month of CI, read from the GitHub API, as Markdown for a run's summary page.

    GH_TOKEN=... GITHUB_REPOSITORY=owner/repo \\
        python3 scripts/ci/monthly_report.py [YYYY-MM] >> "$GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY"

Without a month it reports the one before the current one. It reports:

- releases shipped, and those that needed a fix: a patch release followed
  within ``FIX_WINDOW``, or an issue labelled ``regression`` names the version
  (the change failure rate, target well under 30%);
- time from a push to ``dev`` until ``dev`` is green;
- runs that failed and then passed on a re-run of the same commit, which is
  what a flake or an infrastructure fault looks like from here;
- how long each gate takes.

Standard library only, like the other scripts in this directory.
