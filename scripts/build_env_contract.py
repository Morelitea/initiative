"""Publish what this deployment requires, as data.

Whoever deploys Initiative has to answer one question — *what must I supply?* —
and until now the only honest answer was "read config.py". That file is 1,000
lines and declares 131 settings, of which five are actually mandatory. A
deployment tool that cannot tell those apart either carries all of them or
guesses, and both were happening: the Helm chart in initiative_infra parses this
module with `ast` to find out, and its own `verify-contracts.py` exists because
a required setting once went missing and nothing noticed until two features
failed closed in production.

So the app publishes it instead. Same idea as initiative-github's
`env-contract.json`, which is read rather than parsed, and the same file name, so
one consumer handles every app in the set.

Four classes, because "required" alone is the distinction that misleads:

  required      No default. The app will not start without it.
  runtime       Read once as a first-boot SEED, then owned by a database row and
                edited in Settings -> Platform (config.RUNTIME_SEEDED_SETTINGS).
                An operator does not need these at deploy time at all — which is
                the whole point of publishing them as their own class.
  env_only      Operator credentials for an optional feature with no database
                path, so the only place to set them is the environment. These are
                the ones a deployment tool genuinely must carry.
  optional      Everything else: tunables with defaults that work.

Regenerate after changing Settings, and commit the result:

    scripts/build_env_contract.py

Committed rather than built, because whoever reads it has a checkout and not a
build — the same reason initiative-github commits its own.
