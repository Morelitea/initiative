"""Upgrade a database that a release wrote, and check what the upgrade did.

Every other migration check starts from an empty database, where a backfill
has nothing to move and a ``NOT NULL`` column has no rows to refuse it. This
one starts where a deployment does:

1. Boot the release's published image and fill the database with
   ``upgrade_seed.py`` under that release's code.
2. With ``--walk``, boot every later release's image in turn, as a deployment
   that takes each one does.
3. Boot ``--image``, this tree built as the image a release would publish,
   then seed it again with the current code: the upgraded database has to take
   new writes as well as keep old ones.
4. Build a fresh install with ``--image`` on a second server, seeded the same
   way.

A boot is the image's own start: its entrypoint runs the migrations and serves.
It has booted when it answers on its port; ``--image`` must then also report
every dependency ready and serve the web app, its version and the app-update
manifest.

``--image`` runs as each setup the documentation describes. With one
``DATABASE_URL``, it is reached over plain HTTP at an address other than
``APP_URL``. With explicit logins, it runs as a larger deployment does:
requests, system work and dashboard reads through PgBouncer in transaction
mode, communities in :data:`COHORTS` cohorts, uploads in Garage (S3), and
served over HTTPS by Caddy on :data:`HOSTNAME`, which must resolve to this
host. Releases boot with the logins alone.

and fails when:

* any boot or seed fails, or ``--image`` does not serve what it should;
* a table that held rows before a boot is empty after it;
* the upgraded database differs in structure from the fresh install —
  ``public``, ``guild_template``, and every community schema against a fresh
  one. That is the shape a revision edited after release leaves behind: fresh
  installs get the new body, and upgraded ones never do;
* a second start of the fresh install changes its structure. A start repairs
  what is out of date, so one that changes a current database undoes what the
  migrations set;
* with ``--same-as``, the fresh install differs from the one another run built
  in the other setup. One URL and explicit logins are two ways of giving the
  app the same database, and they must end up with the same one, roles and
  privileges included.

"Structure" is every schema's tables, columns, constraints, indexes, triggers,
policies, functions, grants and default privileges, and the app's roles: their
attributes and memberships.

Each database has its own Postgres server, because roles are cluster-wide and a
community's roles would otherwise be shared between the two.

The containers use the host's network, so the servers' URLs are the same for
them as for this script, and the ports they take (8173, and with explicit
logins 3900, 3901, 6432 and 8443) must be free.

Usage, from ``backend/`` with ``SECRET_KEY`` set, as each boot reads it::

    docker build -t initiative:local --build-arg VERSION=$(cat ../VERSION) ..
    python scripts/upgrade_from_release.py --image initiative:local \\
        --from v0.73.1 \\
        --server postgresql://initiative:initiative@localhost:5432 \\
        --fresh-server postgresql://initiative:initiative@localhost:5433

``--from`` defaults to the newest release tag. ``--walk`` starts at
:data:`WALK_FROM` and boots every release after it, less :data:`WITHDRAWN`.

``--one-url`` runs every boot, of each release and of the current tree, with a
single ``DATABASE_URL`` naming the database owner, as ``docker-compose.example.yml``
does: the app derives its three logins from it. Without it, each boot is given
the three logins and the owner URL explicitly. The walk then starts at
:data:`ONE_URL_FROM`, the first release that could run that way.
