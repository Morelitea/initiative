"""Fill a database with one community's worth of content, using the checkout's
own test factories.

Run from the ``backend/`` directory of *any* release checkout, with that
release's environment: ``python <path>/upgrade_seed.py``. Every name it imports
is resolved in that release, so the rows are the ones that release writes —
which is what an upgrade from it has to carry. It is kept to the factories
every supported release has; ``upgrade_from_release.py`` runs it against the
release an upgrade starts from, and against the current tree.

The connection is the database owner, as the test suite's is:
``DATABASE_URL_BOOTSTRAP`` where the logins are given explicitly, and
``DATABASE_URL`` where one owner URL is all the app is given: the factories write shared and guild tables directly, the way
fixtures do, rather than through a request.
