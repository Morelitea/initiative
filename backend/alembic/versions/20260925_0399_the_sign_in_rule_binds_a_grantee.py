"""A community's sign-in rule binds a grantee as it binds a member.

``public.guild_auth_satisfied()`` read the community from
``app.current_guild_id``, which only a member's routing sets. A request on a
content or settings grant names its community in ``app.pam_guild_id`` or
``app.settings_guild_id``, so the gate found no rule and answered yes. It now
reads whichever of the three names the community, as the standing does.
