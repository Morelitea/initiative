"""a mention keeps no name

A mention of somebody with an account is stored by id alone, and the app takes
the name out on every write. This takes it out of what was written before:
``@[Ada](42)`` becomes ``@[](42)`` in markdown, and a Lexical mention node
keeps its ``mentionUserId`` with ``mentionName`` and ``text`` empty. A mention
of somebody with no account keeps its name, which is all it has. Text inside an
editor state is what somebody typed, not markdown, and is left alone.

The columns are stated here rather than read from any registry, so this
revision reads the same whatever the modules say later. Archived, template and
trashed rows are rewritten too. A document's or wiki page's collaboration
state, which an editor from before can have written a name into, has its
mentions made nameless the same way, as an edit on top of it. The tables' row
security and request triggers (the freeze, change capture, search) are held
while rows change, and a guild with rows changed has its search marker
cleared, so the next start reindexes it. Rows are read in batches.

The downgrade leaves content as it is: the names are kept nowhere.
