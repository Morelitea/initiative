"""Where a state-changing request came from, for cookie-authenticated callers.

The session cookie authenticates ordinary API requests, not only the refresh
route: ``get_current_user`` falls back to it when no ``Authorization`` header
is present. So for those callers this asks for one more thing before an unsafe
method is allowed through -- that the request came from a page this deployment
serves.

Scope, and why it is drawn here:

* **Only cookie-authenticated callers.** An ``Authorization`` header is never
  attached by a browser on someone else's behalf, so bearer tokens, API keys
  and device tokens are not asked for anything. That is also what keeps mobile
  shells and API scripts working unchanged.
* **Unsafe methods, and every WebSocket handshake.** ``OPTIONS`` is excluded
  along with the read methods: it is the CORS preflight and is answered before
  this runs. A handshake has no method to branch on and opens a two-way
  channel, so it is treated as state-changing.
* **No token to mint, store or rotate.** A synchroniser or double-submit token
  is a stronger primitive and can be added on top of this later. It also needs
  every client that writes to carry it, which is a change across the whole
  frontend; this is backend-only.
* **``Sec-Fetch-Site: same-site`` is not accepted on its own**, because it
  includes sibling subdomains. Only ``same-origin`` is conclusive by itself;
  anything else is matched against the same origin allowlist CORS uses.
* **A browser that sends no ``Sec-Fetch-*`` at all still has an answer.** Those
  headers are only sent to origins the browser considers trustworthy -- HTTPS,
  ``localhost`` or ``127.0.0.1`` -- so a deployment reached over plain HTTP at
  a LAN name or address never gets the conclusive answer above, however
  same-origin the request is. Comparing the ``Origin`` against the ``Host`` the
  request was addressed to asks the same question from headers a browser always
  sends, which is what keeps such a deployment writable without its operator
  having to match ``APP_URL`` to it by hand.

Detail beyond what the code does lives in the private tracker, per
CLAUDE.md "Security-sensitive comments".
