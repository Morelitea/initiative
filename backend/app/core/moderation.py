"""What can be reported, who handles it, and how a report is settled.

A **report** is what a person sends when they meet something wrong. Where it
goes is decided here and nowhere else — the client sends the same thing from
every surface, and the venue is derived from what was reported:

> A target that resolves to an initiative is that initiative's to moderate.
> Everything else is the platform's.

What may be reported is derived too. Community content is
:class:`~app.core.search.SearchEntityType`, which is already built from
:class:`~app.core.tools.Tool` plus the things that live inside one — so a new
tool becomes reportable with no edit here. Only the identity plane, which has
no tool behind it, is stated.
