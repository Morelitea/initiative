"""The intake streams: what kinds of work arrive, and what feeds each one.

A **stream** is a named kind of operations work — security, moderation,
support, feedback. It is code rather than configuration because *its sources
are code*: what feeds ``security`` is a set of rules that watch the running
system, and what feeds ``moderation`` is a report endpoint. Adding a stream is
a release, exactly as adding an ``AuditEventType`` or a ``Tool`` is, and for
the same reason — one registry drives every surface.

A **binding** is the data half: *this stream, in this guild, lands in that
project.* Bindings live in the guild schema (``intake_bindings``); the
platform's pointer to the guild that holds them is
``app_settings.operations_guild_id``.

Nothing here names a company or a deployment. A deployment that has bound no
stream shows none of these surfaces and every writer call is a no-op.
