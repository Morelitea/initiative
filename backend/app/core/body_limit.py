"""ASGI body-size enforcement for every HTTP request.

A route marked with :func:`max_body` gets its own bound; every other request
gets :data:`DEFAULT_MAX_REQUEST_BYTES`, or :data:`MULTIPART_MAX_REQUEST_BYTES`
when it is a multipart upload. The route is the one the router will run
(:mod:`app.core.routing`), so the bound follows the route as it is declared.

A handler-level ``Content-Length`` check is too late: FastAPI resolves the
request body (and parses JSON) before any handler code runs, and a chunked
request carries no ``Content-Length`` at all. This middleware enforces the
bound at the transport seam instead — the declared length is rejected before
a byte is read, and a chunked/lying stream is cut off the moment it exceeds
the limit, so no more than ``limit`` bytes are ever buffered.

Pure ASGI (not ``BaseHTTPMiddleware``): it must wrap ``receive`` itself.
Limits are read per request, so test-time monkeypatches apply.
