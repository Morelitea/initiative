"""The optional cookie categories Initiative knows about, and which of them a
given deployment actually uses.

Two separate questions, deliberately:

*What categories exist* is code. A category is here because Initiative has
something that would use it — an analytics integration compiled into the app,
say — not because an operator typed its name in. Nobody invents one.

*Which of them this deployment uses* is configuration, read at request time.
An integration that ships in the app is still off until the deployment
configures it, which is the normal state for somebody running this on their
own server, so most deployments use none of these.

Only the second list is offered to a visitor. A switch for something the
deployment does not do would collect an answer about nothing, and record a
refusal of something nobody was doing.
