"""The ways a person may sign in to this deployment.

The canonical set. ``app_settings.login_methods`` stores a subset of it as a
Postgres enum array, the settings surface renders one checkbox per member, and
the frontend mirrors these values (kept honest by a drift test). Adding a
method — passkeys, magic-link — is a value here, a Postgres ``ALTER TYPE ... ADD
VALUE``, and a refusal point; no column and no schema reshaping.

A *method* is a way of proving who you are at the start of a session. Device
tokens and API keys are not members: they are credentials derived from a
sign-in that already happened, so disabling a method must never invalidate one.
