"""Smart chips — the facts a chip can show about a thing it references.

A reference (:mod:`app.core.references`) names something and resolves to what
it is called. A chip goes one step further and shows a fact ABOUT it that
changes on its own: the column a task sits in, a counter's reading, when an
event is.

Only the facts live here. Which kinds can be referred to at all is a reference
question, not a chip one.
