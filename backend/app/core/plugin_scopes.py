"""The scopes a plug-in can be granted in a community — the one vocabulary.

A scope is ``<resource>:<access>``: ``projects:write``, ``comments:read``. The
resources are derived from the registries that already define the things they
name, so a new tool is a new scope the moment it joins ``Tool``:

- one resource per tool, spelled as the tool's plural;
- ``comments``, ``relationships`` and ``tags``, the surfaces that span tools;
- ``properties``, an initiative's custom property definitions. A value set on
  an item answers to the scope of the tool that governs the item instead;
- ``sharing``, a resource's grants: reading who has access, and changing it
  where the plug-in's own rung on the resource would let a person;
- ``members`` and ``initiatives``, which are read-only.

Writing implies reading. :func:`expand` applies that once, so no later check
has to ask twice.

Two more name a **standing** rather than a resource: ``initiatives:moderate``
(acting as a moderator in an initiative the plug-in is placed in) and
``community:admin`` (acting with a community admin's standing). A grant holds them by
exact name, :func:`expand` gives them nothing, and no token carries one unless
it asks for it by its level (:class:`InstallLevel`); see
``app.services.marketplace.plugin_oauth``.

Beside that fixed vocabulary sits one open family: ``plugins:<public_id>``, which
lets a plug-in call another plug-in's public endpoints through Initiative. It names
no resource of the community's, so :func:`expand` gives it nothing; it is
parsed by its prefix and the public-id characters (:func:`plugin_scope_target`)
rather than listed, and a grant holds it by exact name.

Dependency-free apart from ``Tool``, so ``app.db``'s registry layer can import
it.
