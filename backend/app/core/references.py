"""What can be referred to, and how a reference is written down.

A reference names one thing: ``task:12``. Everything that points at work is
built on it — a `#` link, a `[[ ]]` link, an `@` mention, and the smart chips
that add a fact about the thing on top.

This module owns the vocabulary because it belongs to all of those shapes and
to none of them in particular — including how one is READ back out of something
somebody wrote, which is the same question whether the body is a Lexical editor
state or the running text of a comment.

What a reference RESOLVES to — the column holding the name, the resource whose
sharing gates it — is derived from the search registry in
:mod:`app.db.reference_targets`, which needs the models.
