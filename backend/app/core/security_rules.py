"""The security rules: what, seen often enough, opens a security case.

A rule watches audit events — or **signals**, the high-volume rejections that
are counted and never written down — and counts them per key over a fixed
window. When a key's count reaches the rule's threshold within one window, the
deployment opens a security case about it (``app.services.platform
.security_signals``), and keeps adding to that case while the run lasts rather
than opening one per event.

The thresholds are constants, reviewed in code like everything else that
decides what the people running a server are woken for, rather than
settings.
