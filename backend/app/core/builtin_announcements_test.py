"""The notices this build ships have to be usable notices.

Everything here is about the real registry rather than a fixture: a builtin is
edited by hand in source, is not validated by any endpoint on the way in, and
is wrong in ways nobody sees until it is in front of every admin on every
deployment. A screenshot that was never committed is the likeliest of those.
