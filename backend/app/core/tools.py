"""The canonical ``Tool`` enum — the app-wide set of shareable tool kinds.

A tool is a first-class thing an initiative offers. Every tool is the same shape:
a soft-deletable content table under initiative-member RLS, shared via
``resource_grants`` (its string value IS the ``resource_type``). The single source
of truth for that set — the DAC registries and every tool endpoint reference it
rather than repeating string literals. Kept free of app imports beyond the leaf
``errors`` and ``messages`` modules, so it can be imported anywhere. ``tools_test.py`` asserts every per-tool surface covers
this enum, so a new member that forgets to wire one fails CI.
