"""Showing an address back without disclosing it.

Read paths return a shortened form of an address rather than the address
itself. The shortened form keeps enough for a reader to recognise an address
they already have — matching a support ticket to a row, telling one pending
invite from another — and drops the rest.

Masking is applied by the response shapes (``AdminUserRead``,
``GuildInviteRead``, ``AccessGrantRead``) rather than by each endpoint, so a
new route serving one of those shapes gets it without doing anything. The
stored address is read in full only where the reader is its owner
(``/users/me``) and by the code that sends mail.
