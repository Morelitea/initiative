"""What this process measures, for Prometheus to read.

The metric objects live here and nothing else does. The request edge
(:mod:`app.core.request_audit`) records requests and sockets, the engines
(:mod:`app.db.session`) record statements, and ``/api/v1/metrics`` on the
health router answers the scrape.

Labels are route templates, methods, status codes, engine names and account or
community statuses — never a community or a person, so a series never names
who it is about.

Every series is per process. A deployment running several replicas is
scraped once per replica: request and statement series add up across them
with ``sum``, while the platform totals — the same count read by each — are
taken with ``max``.
