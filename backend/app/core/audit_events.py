"""The catalogue of things Initiative writes down.

One enum drives every surface — the table, the ingestible line, the board, the
filters — so adding a newly-audited action is an enum member, which carries its
own category, tier and write flag, and one ``record()`` call at the site. There
is no second list to keep in step.

There are two tiers. Tier 1 is the privileged
-access family, which is meant for immutable storage as well; Tier 2 is
everything else Initiative owns. Nothing here ships anywhere yet — the tier is
recorded now so the shipper does not have to reclassify history later.

Initiative records only actions whose authority it enforces itself. Infra
access, the identity provider's own sign-ins and billing all emit their own
streams; the envelope carries the fields that stitch them together downstream.
