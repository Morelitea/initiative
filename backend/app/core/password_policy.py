"""Password policy enforcement for new and changed passwords.

Aligned with NIST SP 800-63B (rev. 3, 2017):

  - Minimum length 12. The schema layer enforces ``max_length=256``
    so an over-long payload is rejected before it ever reaches argon2
    or HIBP.
  - No character-class requirements (mandated complexity rules push
    users toward predictable patterns and reduce real entropy).
  - Reject passwords present in known breach corpora.

The login path is intentionally NOT routed through this module —
existing users with shorter or breached passwords keep working until
the next time they change one ("grandfathered"). All new password
material flows (register, password reset, self-update, operator-update)
must call ``validate_new_password`` immediately before hashing.

# own; short passwords reach the policy here and surface a flat
# ``PASSWORD_TOO_SHORT`` code rather than Pydantic's structured detail.
# The schema-level ``max_length=256`` does fire first for over-long
# input, by design — see ``hibp.is_password_breached`` and the
# argon2 cost of hashing huge payloads.
