"""Resolved captcha configuration with a process-wide cache.

``app.services.captcha`` verifies a token from two places that hold no database
session: ``is_configured`` is synchronous, and ``verify_or_raise`` is called
from the register endpoint with the caller's own session, which is the wrong one
to read ``app_setting_secrets`` on (no request-path role is granted it). So the
resolved configuration is kept as a process-level snapshot here, exactly as
``app.services.storage_config`` does for the storage backend, and for the same
reason.

- :func:`current_captcha_config` is the synchronous accessor. Before the first
  database load — and in CLI scripts and tests — it falls back to the env
  ``settings``, so behaviour matches the pre-database world.
- :func:`refresh_captcha_config` reloads it from ``app_settings`` and the secret
  from ``app_setting_secrets``. Called at startup and after every settings
  update.
- :func:`ensure_captcha_config_fresh` reloads once the snapshot is older than
  :data:`_TTL_SECONDS`, on a system-engine session of its own so a caller with
  no session can still get a current answer. That bounds how long a worker
  process that did not handle the update keeps enforcing the old secret.
