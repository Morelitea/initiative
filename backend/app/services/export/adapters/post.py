"""Post source adapter: the importable backup envelope (json).

A post's body is a Lexical editor state, so the envelope carries it whole and
an import rebuilds the notice exactly — the same thing the document envelope
does with ``content``. Rendered formats (md/pdf/docx) go through the Lexical
converter and are not offered yet; a notice exports as the thing it is.

What the envelope deliberately drops is the pin. A pin is a fact about the
board — "this is what matters here right now" — not about the notice, so
carrying it across would put an imported post above the posts already on
somebody else's board.

A poll crosses as the **question**, never the answers. A ballot is one person
in one community saying something, and the ids naming them mean nothing in the
guild a backup is restored into — the same reason the sharing is not carried.
So does its close time, for the reason the pin is dropped: it said when the
question stopped mattering on the board it came from.

A notice that has not gone up is not exported at all — see
``posts.list_post_ids_for_export``. An export is a record of what a board has
said, and a scheduled draft has said nothing yet.

Access rule: READ on the post (exporting is a formatted read), enforced by the
``get_post_for_export`` seam at both count and build time, under the caller's
RLS session.
