"""Helpers shared by the source adapters, and the base every per-tool source
is built on.

A tool's export is the same shape every time: take the selection out of the
job params, fetch each entity under the caller's RLS session, count the rows
it is worth, and turn it into a render item named after the entity and the
date. ``ToolExportAdapter`` holds that shape and derives the registry key and
the envelope suffix from the tool's own ``Tool`` value, the way
``tool_envelope_type`` already does — so a per-tool module states only which
rows it loads and how one row serialises.
