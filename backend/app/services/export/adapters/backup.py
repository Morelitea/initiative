"""Aggregate export sources: a whole initiative or a whole guild, one zip.

Two modes ride one selector (persisted in the job row, replayed by the
worker):

* ``backup`` — every included tool in its importable format (the per-tool
  JSON envelopes the single-entity exports emit), plus optionally the upload
  blobs the exported documents reference, indexed by a root ``manifest.json``
  (see ``schemas/tenant/backup_export.py``). One archive a future import
  wizard consumes whole.
* ``report`` — the same enumeration rendered in per-tool report formats
  chosen by the caller (a project PDF beside a queue CSV beside a calendar
  ICS), zipped with the same folder layout, no manifest/assets.

Layout (identical for both scopes — an initiative backup is a guild backup
with one ``initiatives/`` entry, so ONE import path serves both)::

    manifest.json                                   (backup mode)
    initiatives/{id}-{slug}/projects/{id}-{slug}.initiative-project.json
    initiatives/{id}-{slug}/documents/{id}-{slug}.json
    initiatives/{id}-{slug}/queues/{id}-{slug}.initiative-queue.json
    initiatives/{id}-{slug}/counter-groups/{id}-{slug}.initiative-counter-group.json
    initiatives/{id}-{slug}/calendars/{id}-{slug}.initiative-calendar.json
    initiatives/{id}-{slug}/posts/{id}-{slug}.initiative-post.json
    initiatives/{id}-{slug}/wikis/{id}-{slug}.initiative-wiki.json
    initiatives/{id}-{slug}/galleries/{id}-{slug}.initiative-gallery.json
    initiatives/{id}-{slug}/dashboards/{id}-{slug}.initiative-dashboard.json
    initiatives/{id}-{slug}/structure.json          (backup mode)
    initiatives/{id}-{slug}/properties.json         (backup mode)
    assets/{storage_key}                            (include_uploads only)

Authorization: the initiative source requires the creator to reach each
initiative (``initiative_access`` — member, guild admin, or live PAM grant);
the guild source additionally requires the creator to be a guild ADMIN,
re-checked here so the worker's render-time replay fails closed if adminship
was revoked between request and render. Within an initiative, enumeration is
DAC-visible-only per tool, and every entity still passes its own
fetch+authorize seam. Projects are included with READ access — the
deliberate aggregate-export relaxation of the standalone write rule.

Per tool: what a tool's rows are, how one is loaded and how it serialises is
its export adapter's (``ADAPTERS``). A ``BackupSection`` states only what the
aggregate adds — which report formats it offers, and the hooks for the tools
whose entries carry more than their envelope — and one loop writes every
section.

Long builds: the worker's creator-routed session enforces
``RLS_CONTEXT_MAX_AGE_SECONDS``; ``build`` re-validates via
``establish_guild_access`` between tool chunks (which also fails closed on
mid-build access revocation).
