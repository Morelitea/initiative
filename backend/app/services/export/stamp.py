"""Who exported a file, and when — kept in the file, not printed on it.

Added at the render choke points (inline export + worker replay) beside the
brand, as ``exported`` on every item a renderer turns into a document:
``{"by": <name>, "date": {year, month, day, hour, minute, second}}`` in UTC.
The parts spread straight into Typst's ``datetime(..)``. Each renderer writes it
where its format keeps metadata: PDF document info, DOCX/XLSX core properties,
and a Markdown comment. JSON envelopes carry their own ``exported_at``; CSV,
iCalendar and passthrough files have nowhere to put it.
