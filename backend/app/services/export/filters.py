"""What narrows a tool's export: the tool's own list filters, and the filter
its content declares.

An export of a tool is that tool's list, rendered. So its filters are not
declared here: they are read off the tool's list route (``TOOL_LISTS``), and a
filter the list gains is one the export takes. A tool whose contents have a
filter of their own (a calendar's events by date) names it on its adapter
(``ToolExportAdapter.content_filters``).

Filters are one person's instruction for one render. Nothing keeps them past
the job that carries them.
