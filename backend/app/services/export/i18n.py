"""Locale resolution + translation for export *content* (the strings baked
into generated reports — column headers, titles, footers, status flags,
empty-state messages).

Reuses the JSON loader the email system uses (``app/locales/<locale>/
exports.json``), keyed to the export **creator's** ``user.locale``. That
locale is available at both delivery paths: inline (the request's
``current_user``) and the worker's replay (it loads the full creator row),
so no locale needs to be persisted in the job selector.

Scope: only human-facing report chrome is translated. JSON envelopes stay
canonical (``kind``/``schema_version``/``view_mode`` and field keys are
importable machine data — translating them would break round-trip), and user
data (titles, names, tags, status names) is never touched.
