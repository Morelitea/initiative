"""Where a large archive goes instead of down an HTTP connection.

An export the app serves is read back through this process for as long as the
client's connection lasts, which is fine for a report and not fine for a whole
community. Past ``EXPORT_MAX_DOWNLOAD_BYTES`` the worker writes the archive to
a **destination** the operator configured and records where it landed; the app
never holds it and never serves it.

The destination is a directory on this host — ``EXPORT_DESTINATION_DIR`` — and
deliberately nothing else. Any mount the operator can write to works, so a NAS
share or an encrypted volume is a destination without the deployment needing
credentials for anything, an account anywhere, or a route to the internet. It
is operator-global for the same reason the mail sender is: it is the
deployment's own storage, and a community administrator should not be holding
a path into it.

Unset is the default, and means delivery is not available: an archive over the
download bound is refused rather than built with nowhere to put it.
