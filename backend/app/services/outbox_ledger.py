"""How a queue table's rows are claimed, held and tried again.

The email outbox, the notice outbox and the webhook delivery ledger are each a
table of work that a worker takes, attempts, and settles or backs off. They
share the rules here:

* **A claim is a lease.** A pass holds what it took for :data:`LEASE`; a row
  whose pass never finished is taken again once the lease has run out.
* **A recipient is served by one pass at a time.** The outboxes claim by
  recipient, and a recipient with a row another pass holds waits for it, so
  one person's rows go out in the order they were written.
* **A failure waits longer each time.** The wait is chosen in the statement
  that counts the failure, so two passes racing there cannot both read a stale
  count.
* **A schedule lists every wait.** Each is waited once; a row that fails again
  after the last is given up.
