"""Why a row the request asked for was not there.

Gate 4 is a policy, so a resource a reader may not reach is simply absent by
the time a handler runs — and "not yours" and "not there" are different
answers. This asks the system engine that one question and takes back a yes or
no, never a row.

It is a *status-code* decision, not a gate: nothing here grants access, and
every caller has already been refused by the database before it asks.
