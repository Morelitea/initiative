"""DB-level initiative RLS isolation tests.

These bypass the app layer entirely: they set the guild RLS context and run a raw
``SELECT`` as the assumed guild role, so a missing/incorrect policy fails the
assertion (the app-layer ``membership.py`` clause can't paper over it). Proves the
``initiative_access`` policies on the guild content tables actually enforce
initiative-membership for non-admin guild roles.
