"""The document editor, as the server runs it.

A document's Yjs state and its editor JSON are two views of one document, and
only the editor knows how one maps to the other. So the server runs the same
editor the browser does: its server build (``frontend/src/lib/yjs/serverEditor.ts``,
built by ``pnpm build:editor-server``), in an embedded V8 in worker processes
(:mod:`app.services.editor_worker`, through :mod:`app.services.worker_pool`).

The pool starts on the first call, holds one worker per process, and a worker
idle for ``_IDLE_SECONDS`` exits, so a server where nobody edits a document
never starts the engine.
