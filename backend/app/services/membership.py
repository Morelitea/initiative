"""Shared guild- and initiative-membership checks.

Initiative scoping has **one** definition: the ``initiative_access`` SQL
function (initiative member OR guild admin OR PAM grant, read from the request
GUCs). The guild-schema RLS policies call it, and ``initiative_scope_clause``
here calls the *same* function — for the tables the policies deliberately do
not cover, which is the structural initiative set (``initiatives`` itself and
its roster): those are guild-scoped by the schema boundary, so this clause is
their only scope gate rather than a second opinion on one.

This module also provides a batch guild-role lookup (resolve the role for
many users in one round trip instead of a per-user loop). ``guild_memberships``
is a shared/public table, so it works on any session, routed or not; the scope
clause needs a session already routed into the right guild (``RLSSessionDep``
or ``set_rls_context``), exactly like any other guild-scoped query.
