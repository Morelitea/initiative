    1. **Order.** Each guild returns :func:`_global_ordering_selectables` rows —
       the sort keys and the id, nothing else — *without* ORDER BY, and the

       contribute to it. By id alone: the filters are not re-applied, so a
       concurrent edit cannot drop a row the ordering pass already counted.

    The split is what keeps the cost of this endpoint proportional to the page
    rather than to everything the filter matches: a reader with hundreds of

    loads, comment counts, tag and property annotation for every one of them to
