"""Mention syntax: parsing and anonymization.

Mention patterns in markdown — comments, task descriptions, any description:
- Users: @[](id) - e.g., @[](42), stored by id alone
  (``app.core.identity_boundary.without_mention_names``)
- Anything else: #kind[Title](id) - e.g., #task[Fix bug](123). That half is the
  reference vocabulary, read by ``app.core.references``.

An editor-state body (a document, a post, a wiki page) embeds a mention as a
Lexical ``mention`` node carrying ``mentionUserId``, with ``mentionName`` and
``text`` empty.

Content therefore holds no name for ``anonymize_user_mentions`` to take out;
it takes out what a collaboration state may still hold.
