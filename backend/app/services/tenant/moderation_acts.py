"""What a community's moderators do to content, and the log they do it in.

The **moderation set** of an initiative is whoever reaches everything in it:
the community's admins and the people whose role carries Full access — the
standing ``initiative_full_access`` answers in the database — and the platform
under a ``moderate`` grant. Managing an initiative is not moderating it: a
project manager runs the work, and takes down nobody's words.

Every act is written to ``moderation_actions``, the community's moderation
log, which is append-only (``app.db.moderation_log``):

- **remove** — a comment becomes a tombstone where it was, its words moved
  into the log, sealed; anything else goes to the trash with the moderator as
  the one who put it there. Either way its author is told why, and never by
  whom.
- **restore** — puts back what a removal took down.
- **lock_comments** / **unlock_comments** — a locked thread reads as before,
  and only the moderation set adds to it.
- **clear_reactions** — every reaction on a comment or a post, gone.
- **warn** — the author is told, in the moderator's words.

Who may act, and on what, is read on the moderator's own session: they act on
what they can see, in an initiative they moderate. The act itself is written
on a system session, as the platform writes a hold, because what it touches —
someone else's words, a tombstone, the log — is no member's to write.
