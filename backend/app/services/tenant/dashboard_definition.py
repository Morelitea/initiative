"""Validation and normalization for dashboard definitions.

A definition is a **presentation spec**: a grid layout plus widgets, each bound
to a data source by name. Most dashboards — hand-built or installed from the
marketplace — are simply a *composition* of the built-in widgets below: a
"sprint health" listing is several first-party widgets, arranged and pre-bound. The
marketplace download carries that definition; what this module owns is narrower,
and is the reason a downloaded definition is safe to store — a **capability
check**:

* a widget must name a ``type`` we have a renderer for, and
* a binding must name a ``source`` we have a fetcher for, and one that widget
  can draw.

That closed vocabulary is what stops a definition from naming its own endpoint
or carrying code: there is nowhere to put a URL and nothing generic that would
dereference one. It is also why dashboards are display-only — no source maps to
a mutating route, so no definition can cause a write.

What this module deliberately does **not** do is re-declare the shape of each
binding's parameters. Those belong to the fetcher that consumes them (a
``counter`` binding's ``counter_id``, a ``tasks`` binding's filter-DSL
``conditions``), and mirroring them here would mean maintaining every parameter
in two places. They are stored as given, bounded by the definition size cap, and
checked where they are used: the filter DSL parser enforces its own limits, and
every id is authorized against the viewer by RLS at fetch time.

Normalization mirrors ``documents_spreadsheet``: unrecognized *structure* is
dropped rather than preserved, so a stored definition always has canonical shape.

# --- app widgets ------------------------------------------------------------
#
# A service app contributes its own widgets and its own data sources (§7, §9.1).
# They are deliberately a *separate* vocabulary from the built-ins above rather
# than an addition to it:
#
# * an app widget's type is namespaced ``app:<listing_uid>:<widget_id>``, so it
#   can never resolve to a built-in renderer, and a built-in can never resolve
#   to an app's module;
# * ``app`` is the only source an app widget binds, and no built-in binds it —
#   an app's rows are opaque here, so nothing in this build could draw them.
#
# The binding names a listing and a source; it never names an address, and there
# is still nowhere in a definition to put one. What that source *is* — its
# parameters, its visibility, its freshness — lives in the installed app's
# pinned definition and is enforced when the data is fetched, under the caller's
# own session.
#
# The check here is deliberately shape, not an install lookup: a well-formed
# ``app:<uid>:<widget>`` stores whether or not that app is installed, so a
# stored dashboard outlives the app it drew from. What a guild built is the
# guild's; the client renders the not-installed state and asks for the app to
# be reconnected. Only a malformed type is a rejection.

#: The one binding source an app widget may name.
