"""What the community's own lifecycle does around held content.

A held row (``app.db.holds``) stays where it is: trashing or archiving what it
sits in leaves it as it was, and purging what it sits in waits until the
platform releases it. The database refuses anything that would delete a held
row; these let the lifecycle paths see that coming and step around it, rather
than fail part way.
