"""A file kept as numbered versions: an uploaded file's, a gallery picture's.

The parent row names the version it shows (``current_version_id``) and the
version rows are its history. Both tools take the same steps through here:
number a new version and make it current, copy one for a duplicate, delete
one and point back at the newest left, and take back the stored files a
failed or finished write leaves behind. Every version a row is given has a
type its tool accepts, since that type decides how the file is shown.

A parent's versions are read off its ``versions`` relationship, so the steps
work for any model that keeps one.
