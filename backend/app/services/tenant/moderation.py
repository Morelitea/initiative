"""Filing a report, and settling one.

Where a report goes is not the client's decision. This resolves the target,
derives the venue from the registry the RLS policies are rendered from, and
sends it to one of two places:

- **platform** — an intake case in the operations guild, which is project work
  our own staff triage and assign;
- **initiative** — a row in that community, which its moderators look at and
  decide.

A reporter gains nothing by reporting: the write happens on a routed system
session, and reading the report stays with the people who already see
everything in that initiative.
