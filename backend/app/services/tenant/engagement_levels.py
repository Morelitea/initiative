"""How many people engaged with each item lately, as a coarse level.

Search orders by the level, read through :func:`level_of` beside the item and
gated like the item itself; it only reorders what a search already found. The hourly pass works it out in each active community from two records
the community already keeps, and writes nothing else:

- **Views**: each person's latest open of each item, from ``recent_views``.
- **Contributions**: each change a person made, from the change log. A change to
  something that has no level of its own (a comment, a reaction) counts for the
  innermost item it sits in.

Each person counts once per item, at their weightiest engagement, decayed by
age, so opening something forty times is opening it once. An item gets a level
only once :data:`MIN_PEOPLE` different people engaged with it, and only the
level is kept: no person, no count.

A community that turned ranking off (while it holds the ``restrictions``
option), or a deployment that did, holds no levels: the pass clears them.
