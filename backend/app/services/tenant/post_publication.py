"""Publication of bulletin-board notices — the moment a post goes live.

A post carries two instants: ``scheduled_for``, when its author asked for it to
go up, and ``published_at``, when it did. Everything else keys off the second
one, so "has this been published" is a column test rather than a comparison
against the clock, and the surfaces that list posts cannot disagree with this
worker about what exists.

Two ways in, one fan-out:

* **Posted now** — the endpoint stamps ``published_at`` itself and calls
  :func:`announce_post` before it commits, so the notice and the notices about
  it land together.
* **Scheduled** — the row is written with neither column resolved, and
  :func:`publish_due_posts` stamps it when its time comes. The stamp is an
  ``UPDATE … WHERE published_at IS NULL … RETURNING``, so a row is claimed by
  exactly one worker however many are running, and it is **committed before
  anything is sent**. Email and push leave the building; a rollback cannot
  call them back. Committing the claim first means a crash mid-announce costs
  some notifications, where the other order would send the whole board a
  second set on the next pass. Making delivery exactly-once needs a
  per-recipient ledger, and that is a bar to raise everywhere at once rather
  than for one tool.

Publishing is also what puts a notice into the search index. The index is
maintained by triggers, and no trigger fires on the passage of time — but the
claim above is a real write to the row, and ``published_at`` is one of the
columns the search trigger watches. The statement that publishes is therefore
the statement that indexes.
