"""What the people working an operations case see of how it was filed.

A case is an ordinary task with an ``intake_cases`` row beside it. This reads
that row for the task view: which stream opened it, who filed it and what they
called it, whether the stream holds a conversation with them, and which of the
binding's statuses mean "waiting on them" and "being worked". It also lets
somebody who works the case take it.

Everything is read on the caller's routed session, so a person who cannot read
the task reads nothing here either.
