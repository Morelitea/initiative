"""An installed app asking a member to act as them, and the member's answer.

An app asks for one **purpose** at a time (``purpose`` absent is app-wide). The
member answers on their own consent screen: grant ``read``, grant
``read_write`` (never more than the app asked for), decline, or later revoke.
The community's administration can revoke every answer for one install at once
without uninstalling it.

The rows live in the community's schema. The functions here run on whatever
session their caller routed: the member's own request (own-row policies admit
their rows), the seat's (the admin leg admits every row), or the system engine
routed into the community (the request an app makes, which names no person).

The install standing reads the row on every member-token request, so an answer
changes the next request without anything else being told.
