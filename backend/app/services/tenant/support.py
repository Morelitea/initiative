"""Asking whoever runs this deployment for help.

Two kinds of question, told apart by topic (``SupportTopic``):

- **About a community** (``community``, ``data_request``). Whether its members
  can ask is an **operator** entitlement
  (``guild_administration.support_enabled``), not something the community's
  own admins switch on: the deployment that would receive the requests is the
  one that decides it is staffing them. Off is the default, and the "Ask for
  help" control then offers the support address. A ``data_request`` — a copy
  of the community's data, or its erasure — is its seat holder's to make.
- **About themselves** (``account``, ``billing``, ``other``). Anybody signed
  in may ask wherever support is taken at all: a person locked out of
  something has no community to ask from.

Where a request lands is not this module's business either — it becomes a case
in the ``support`` stream, and the binding says which project that is.
