"""Static guard: uploads are stored through one function.

Every file a person or an import brings into a guild is written by
``attachments.store_upload``, which writes the bytes and adds the ``uploads``
row the serve route requires and the storage quota sums. Two shapes are
confined to it and to a short list of named exceptions:

* ``Upload(...)`` — a row for a stored file.
* A function that takes a guild's storage (``get_guild_storage(...)``) and
  writes to it (``.write`` / ``.write_file``, called or handed to a thread).

The exceptions store something that is not an upload — an export artifact, a
staged import payload — or record a copy of bytes already stored. A new
upload path that writes around ``store_upload`` fails here instead of relying
on a reviewer to notice.

The walk is syntactic, like ``app/api/context_seam_guard_test.py``: it reads
each function as written and does not follow a storage handle passed in from
somewhere else.
