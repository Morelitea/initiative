"""The poll row is the lock its ballots and its edits queue on.

Reading what has been answered and then acting on it is two statements, and
between them anything can happen: a first ballot landing while an edit has just
decided there were none would be cascaded away by that edit, and two of one
person's ballots racing each other would merge into a third answer neither of
them sent.

These cases hold the two halves of that: the lock is really taken (a second
transaction waits for it), and whether the poll is still open is decided by the
database's clock inside the same statement — so a deadline cannot pass between
the question and the ballot.
