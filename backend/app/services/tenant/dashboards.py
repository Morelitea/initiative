"""Dashboard service — loaders and helpers for the dashboard tool.

A dashboard is a shareable DAC resource (``resource_type='dashboard'``) whose
``definition`` is a validated presentation spec. It owns no child content: the
data it displays lives in other tools and is fetched per viewer through those
tools' own gated endpoints, so the loaders here only need what serialization
and the permission engine read.
