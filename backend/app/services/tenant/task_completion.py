"""Keep ``Task.completed_at`` in step with the task's status category.

``completed_at`` is derived state: a task is complete exactly when its status
sits in the ``done`` category. The timestamp is stamped on the way in and
cleared on the way out, so ``completed_at IS NOT NULL`` and "the task's status
is done" always agree. Consumers (stats, digests, the My Tasks focus list) can
then trust the column instead of proxying completion with ``updated_at``.

Two kinds of writer have to route through here:

* anything that assigns ``Task.task_status_id`` — :func:`sync_completed_at`;
* the status edit that changes a ``TaskStatus.category``, which flips done-ness
  for every task sitting in it without touching a single task row —
  :func:`resync_status_tasks`.

The per-task rule is deliberately *state-derived* rather than edge-triggered:
it reads the category the task holds now, not the one it held before, so a
caller never has to thread the previous value through, and re-running it on an
unchanged task is a no-op. That is also what keeps a move between two different
``done`` statuses from resetting the original completion time.
