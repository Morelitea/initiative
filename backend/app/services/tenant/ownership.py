"""Content ownership — who owns a tool, and what happens when they leave.

Ownership and authorship are different things, and this module only deals with
the first:

- **Author** — who wrote it: ``created_by``, one column on every guild table
  that records one (:class:`CreatedByMixin`). A historical fact. Nothing here
  ever changes one.
- **Owner** — who owns it: the ``resource_grants`` row at
  ``level='owner'``. A live permission, and the only thing this module moves.

Comments, tasks and uploads have an author and no owner at all; they take
their permissions from the tool that holds them. The members of :class:`Tool` are
exactly the things that have an owner, so :data:`OWNABLE` derives from that enum
and ``ownership_test.py`` fails if a tool is ever missing from it.

**Ownership is optional.** There is no "ownerless" grant row — the
``resource_grants_one_grantee`` constraint requires every row to name one
grantee — so having no owner is the *absence* of an owner grant, which is also
the honest way to say it. The owner row names a person or an installed app
(:class:`Owner`), and one rule follows:

    An owner is a current member of the guild, a live install, or nobody.

A live install is one that is switched on. What an app owns stays its own while
it is off, and is listed as unowned until it is switched back on; uninstalling
removes its owner rows with it (the foreign key cascades), so its content
becomes unowned like a departed member's.

Leaving a guild drops the person's owner grants rather than handing them to
someone else: nobody inherits privilege they did not ask for, which matters most
in a guild with heavy turnover. Guild admins still administer unowned content
through their guild-admin authority, and can claim it whenever they choose, or
hand it to an app that may own it (:func:`eligible_app_owners`).
