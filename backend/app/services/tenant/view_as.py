"""A dashboard that runs as its initiative.

A tile ordinarily answers from whoever is looking at it. A dashboard can
instead run as its initiative (``Dashboard.view_mode == "initiative"``): its
query widgets then read with full read access to the dashboard's initiative,
the same for everybody who can open it. It is the dashboard's access, not any
one person's, so it does not change with who turned it on.

What that access is, precisely: the reader's own routed context with two
things added for that one initiative — "Full access" (the sharing override a
role can hold) and every tool's view permission. Everything else still holds:

* the dashboard's own gates decide who can open it at all, before this runs;
* the statement runs on the query role, which holds ``SELECT`` and nothing
  more, in a read-only transaction;
* it is narrowed to the dashboard's initiative, and a tool the initiative has
  switched off stays off;
* what runs is the statement stored on the widget, never one a reader sends.

Who may turn it on, and who may change the widgets while it is on, is an
initiative role permission (``dashboards_run_as_initiative``) that managers
always hold: :func:`may_run_as_initiative`.
