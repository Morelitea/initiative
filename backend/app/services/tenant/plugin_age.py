"""Whether somebody is old enough for a plug-in, where they are.

A plug-in may declare ``minimum_age`` by ISO 3166-1 country, with ``default``
for every country it does not list — the age of digital consent differs by
country (13 under COPPA in the US, up to 16 under the GDPR). This module is the
one place that answers it for one person, and every path a person uses a
plug-in through asks it: the page handoff and the sidebar that offers it
(through ``guild_plugins.surface_access``), a widget's data, and connecting an
account or consenting to be acted for.

Two facts feed it, and neither is the client's to state:

* **Age** — from the date of birth the account gave, kept encrypted
  (``users.birthdate_of``). No date on file is *not allowed*: the person is
  asked for one, once, and until they answer nothing age-limited opens. On a
  deployment whose owner has turned the age check off
  (``community_age_gate_enabled``), every account counts as an adult and no
  limit applies.
* **Country** — from the request, through the header a trusted proxy in front
  of the deployment writes (``CLIENT_COUNTRY_HEADER``, ``CF-IPCountry`` behind
  Cloudflare). Read per request and never stored. Not configured, absent, or
  not a country (``XX`` unknown, ``T1`` Tor) is *not known*, and then the
  plug-in's **highest** declared age applies, so not knowing where somebody is
  never lets them in younger.

Installs are never refused here: a community installs what it likes, and the
answer is per person.
