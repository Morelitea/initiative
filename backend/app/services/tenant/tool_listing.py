"""The query behind every guild-wide tool list — search, scope, order, page.

The guild home shows one table for whichever tool is selected, so the nine list
endpoints behind it have to answer the same questions the same way: which rows
are in scope, what the search box narrows, how the three shared columns order,
and where the page boundary falls. Those answers live here once and each tool
supplies only what is genuinely its own — its model, what to eager-load, how a
row becomes a summary, and the order it falls back to.

Ordering belongs in SQL rather than in whichever page the caller happens to be
holding: a sort that only reaches the twenty rows in hand is not a sort of the
guild's work, it is a sort of the accident of pagination. Searching those lists
is ``search.tool_search_clause``, which reads the same index the search page
does.

**Two scope clauses, and they are not the same clause.** A *list* uses
``permissions.listing_scope_clause``: confined to one initiative it adds
nothing, because the table's own policy already asked the question, and
spanning initiatives it falls back to what has been granted. A *count* uses
``permissions.granted_scope_clause`` directly: a count is always guild-wide, so
it has no single initiative to ask about and the "granted to the reader" rule
is the only one that applies. Keeping them apart is what lets one initiative's
list show a guild admin everything while the sidebar badge beside it still
counts what actually reaches them.

Each tool keeps its own default order (a project's is the manual one its owner
dragged into place, a calendar's is by name), so a request that asks for none
of these is left exactly as it was.
