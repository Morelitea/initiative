"""Holding what a guild typed into an app's connection form.

The load-bearing property is custody: a secret goes in, is stored encrypted, and
the only thing that ever comes back out through a read is *whether* it is there.
So the tests assert on both halves — that the value round-trips for the one
caller entitled to it, and that the presence map carries no trace of it.

The rest is validation against the *pinned* definition. Types are checked
exactly rather than coerced, because a form that turns ``true`` into ``1`` for
an int field has silently accepted something the app never declared it would
receive.
