"""Poll service — writing the question, counting the answers.

A poll belongs to exactly one post and is reached through it, so nothing here
authorizes anything: the endpoints resolve the post first, through the same
``resource_access`` seam every other post route uses, and hand the poll over.
What lives here is the part that is genuinely the poll's own — who is allowed
to have answered, and what the numbers mean.

Two rules are worth stating outright, because both are decisions rather than
mechanics:

**A ballot is replaced, never appended to.** Voting sends the whole answer, and
the service clears the voter's previous rows before writing the new ones. That
is what makes changing your mind a vote rather than a second vote, and it is
the same statement whether the poll takes one answer or several.

**A poll's row is the lock its ballots and its edits queue on.** Editing the
question, casting a ballot and retracting one each decide what to write by
reading what has already been answered, so each takes the poll row with
:func:`lock_poll` first and holds it until the transaction commits. That makes
one poll's writes a queue: each sees a settled answer, acts on it, and hands the
row to the next. Whether the poll is still open is asked in the same statement,
by the database's clock, so the deadline a ballot is measured against is the one
in force when the row is taken.

**Every ballot counts, and the sharing decides only who is still expected to
answer.** A read receipt asks "who still needs to see this", so it is measured
against the audience as it is now and a departed member's receipt drops out of
it. A poll asks "what did people say", and that a person said it does not stop
being true when they leave — so the tallies count every ballot, and the notice's
current audience is used for one thing only: the list of people who have not
answered yet. The two sides then still add up, which is what the narrowing was
there to protect.
