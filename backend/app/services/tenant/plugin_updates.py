"""Moving an install onto a newer version of its listing.

One function does the re-pin, and two callers ask for it: a guild admin
pressing Update, and the sweep below that applies published versions to the
installs tracking them. Writing that reasoning twice is how the two would come
to disagree about what an upgrade leaves behind — so the endpoint keeps the
HTTP vocabulary and this keeps the meaning.

**Auto is the resting state.** An install tracks its listing unless a guild
admin says otherwise, because an install quietly falling behind its publisher is
the worse default: a fix reaches the guild without anyone having to notice it
exists. Turning it off is a guild's own answer to "we read each version first",
and the manual Update button then does exactly what this sweep would have.

**A version that asks for more waits.** Asking for more is a grantable scope
neither the install's grant nor its pinned version already names, or a surface
inside initiatives the pinned version does not have. The sweep does not apply
such a version: it records it as ``pending_version`` and tells the community's
seat once, and the install keeps running its pinned version with its current
grant. The seat accepts it from the Update button, adding the scopes it
consents to, or declines it, which stops the asking until a newer version is
published. A version asking for nothing new applies as before.

**A required plug-in does not wait.** The deployment's registration is what
installed it and granted what it requests within the ceiling, with no seat
asked; its newer versions are applied the same way, adding the new scopes
within the ceiling. A community with no seat holder would otherwise keep a
required plug-in on a version it can no longer serve.

What survives an upgrade is the same either way. Stored configuration is pruned
to what the new definition still declares — a value cannot outlive the field it
was typed into — and a connection the new version dropped is *revoked* rather
than merely forgotten, since the plug-in is still holding whatever that credential
bought it.
