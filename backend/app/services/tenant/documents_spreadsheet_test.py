"""Unit tests for the spreadsheet-content normalizer.

The normalizer decides what a saved workbook contains: it builds its output
from an allow-list of known keys, so anything it doesn't name is discarded.
That makes it the place a schema addition is most easily forgotten, and the
failure is quiet — the live collaborative document keeps carrying the new
field, so the feature works for a whole session and is gone on reload.
