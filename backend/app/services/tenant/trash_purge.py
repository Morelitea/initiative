"""Auto-purge background worker for trashed entities past their retention.

Visited by the hourly pass in every active guild, on a system session routed
into the guild's schema; the policies' system leg names that login. See

Each table's due rows are purged together, parents first, through the same
``hard_purge_entities`` the trash can's purge button uses: documents and
pictures take their stored files with them, and descendants go before the rows
they hang off.
