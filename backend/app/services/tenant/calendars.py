"""Calendar container service — loaders and helpers for the calendar tool.

A calendar is the shareable DAC anchor for its events (``resource_type=
'calendar'``); events inherit access from it the way tasks inherit from their
project, so the loaders here eager-load ``grants`` and the level the request
holds on the calendar.

Two kinds of calendar live here. Nearly all of them belong to an initiative. A
**guild calendar** — the one the calendar plug-in installs — belongs to none, and
that is the whole of what it is: a set of its own events, holding nothing from
any initiative and reaching into none. Its ``initiative_id`` is NULL, so
anything derived from an initiative has nothing to derive from and refuses.
