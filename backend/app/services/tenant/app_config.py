"""Reading an install's connection schema, and holding what was typed into it.

An app declares *connections* — named groups of typed fields — and the pinned
definition is the only description of them this build trusts. A guild's answers
are validated against that pinned copy rather than against whatever the catalog
says today, so upgrading a listing can never retroactively change what an
existing install was allowed to store.

Two custody rules run through everything here:

* **A secret goes in and does not come back.** Values typed into a ``secret``
  field are encrypted per key and stored; a read reports only whether a value is
  present. Nothing in the API returns one, to anybody.
* **Managed keys are not typed at all.** A field the manifest marks ``managed``
  is written by the app itself when it completes a vendor flow, so this path
  refuses one rather than letting a form overwrite it.

A guild-wide connection is not always typed. One that declares a ``flow`` is
established by Initiative instead
(:mod:`app.services.tenant.app_connection_flows`): a guild admin runs the
vendor's own flow once — an organization-wide install, on the vendor's page,
where somebody who owns the account grants what it may see — and the app's
``after_connect`` hook says what goes into that connection's managed fields.
The scope is unchanged, since the credential is still the guild's; what
changes is who fills it and how, and :func:`guild_connection_ref` is the
handle the app asks for its token by.

A flow's tokens are held beside the declared fields under reserved keys
(:data:`RESERVED_TOKEN_KEYS`), which no manifest declares and no form writes.

Satisfaction is computed from presence alone — which fields have values. This
build never inspects a credential, calls a vendor, or learns a scope; whether a
credential carries the permissions it needs is the app's to report, and arrives
separately as ``config_state``.
