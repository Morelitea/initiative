"""What an access token's ``sub`` names, and how it resolves back.

An access token names the account by a reference rather than by the row id —
the ``client`` sector of ``services.platform.identity_refs``. Audit rows,
joins and our own logs keep the integer, which is what they are for.

Resolution runs on the request-path session — the same single indexed query
that read ``users`` before. ``identity_refs`` is otherwise system-engine-only;
the grant and the policy that admit this lookup are scoped to this sector
alone (migration ``20260913_0267``).
