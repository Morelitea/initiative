"""A sign-in held between the thing it has proved and the thing it has not.

A password can be correct and the sign-in still unfinished, because the account
holds a second factor. Something has to carry that across two requests.

It is carried as a row: ``consumed_at`` spends it, ``attempts`` counts refused
answers against it, ``expires_at`` ends it, and :func:`revoke_for_user` drops
it when what it rests on moves. It has its own table because every row in
``auth_sessions`` means somebody is signed in, and this is the state of
somebody who is not.

The value handed to the client is random and stored only as a SHA-256 digest,
following ``auth_sessions.refresh_token_hash``: full entropy already, so the
digest is a single indexed lookup rather than a scan.

Everything here runs on the system engine — a challenge is resolved before
there is an authenticated request to scope.
