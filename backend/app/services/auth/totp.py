"""An account's authenticator-app factor: enrolling it, and reading a code.

RFC 6238 arithmetic comes from ``pyotp``; what is here is the part that is
ours — where the seed is kept, when an enrolment becomes real, and which codes
count.

**Enrolling is two steps.** ``begin_enrolment`` mints a seed and writes it
unconfirmed; ``confirm_enrolment`` takes a code the authenticator produced and
sets ``confirmed_at``. Only a confirmed factor is asked for at sign-in, so an
enrolment that was started and abandoned asks nothing of anybody. A second
begin replaces an unconfirmed row.

**A code counts once.** ``user_totp.last_timestep`` records the interval an
accepted code came from, and a later code has to come from a later interval.

**Codes either side of now are accepted**, one interval each way, which is
RFC 6238's own allowance for clocks that disagree.

Everything here runs on the system engine: ``user_totp`` and its companion are
read while signing in, before there is an authenticated request to scope.
