"""Which of the platform's providers a community signs its members in through.

The division of labour this implements: **the operator holds providers, a
community connects to one.** An operator says this deployment can sign people
in with Google; a community says its members come in through that, and only its
own workspace. A community supplies no issuer, no client id and no secret — so
it names no address the deployment will fetch, and there is no provider
configuration for it to get wrong on behalf of its members.

Two readers and one writer live here. Login asks which providers a
community connects to and applies what it said about them; the CRUD answers to
the superadmin seat, on the system engine. The gate asks a third question —
does this credential satisfy one of them — and that one defers to
``public.guild_connection_admits`` so the rule has one statement rather than
two.
