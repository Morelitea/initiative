"""A sign-in finished in the phone's browser, handed back to the app.

The app cannot hold an identity provider's redirect or a passkey ceremony
itself, so it opens the phone's browser and the sign-in finishes there. What
comes back through ``initiative://oidc/callback`` is a one-time code, not a
credential: the app redeems it over HTTPS with the PKCE verifier it generated
when it began (RFC 8252 §7.1, RFC 7636), and the session opens then.

The code is the sign-in's outcome sealed under :data:`SALT_NATIVE_HANDOFF`, and
it is recorded as an ``auth_challenges`` row answered by the app's challenge, so
it is spent once, counts its attempts, expires in :data:`CODE_TTL` and goes
when the account's password or factors change.
