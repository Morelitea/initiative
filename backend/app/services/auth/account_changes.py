"""What an account notice records about its change, and undoing it.

Four notices can be undone from their "This wasn't me" link: an address proved,
the primary moved, an address removed, a passkey added. A notice that a change
is waiting is answered the same way, and undoing it cancels the change. Each
records, when it is queued, what undoing it would do, whether the change was
risky, and the proof time of the newest address involved. The worker gives a
copy the power to undo only where the change was risky and the copy's address
was proved before that newest one; :func:`apply_undo` carries it out.
