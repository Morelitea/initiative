"""Wrong passwords and codes, counted per account.

Five wrong answers within fifteen minutes lock the account's password and codes.
The first lock within a day lasts fifteen minutes, the second an hour, and the
third and every one after it four hours. Every lock ends on its own; a password
reset from the emailed link, or a moderator, ends it sooner. Passkeys and
sessions already open are not affected.

Every function here stages its writes on the caller's system-engine session;
the caller commits. The one exception is the count kept by address
(``app.core.rate_limit``), which is not in the database: :func:`lift` starts it
over at once.
