"""Agreeing that a community's claim values are its to claim.

A community says which arrivals on a provider are its own by naming a claim
and the values that count — a Google Workspace domain, an Entra tenant. It
names them itself, and nothing here can tell whether it holds the one it
wrote, so somebody outside the community answers that: support, through a case
raised when the values are written, or the operator on the community's own
page where the deployment runs no intake.

What waits for the answer is ``auto_join`` and nothing else. A connection
still decides who may use its button the moment it is saved, so a community
narrowing its own sign-in is not held up; what it cannot do unanswered is
place somebody in itself.
