"""Discretionary Access Control (DAC) — per-resource sharing.

The application-level permission layer for every tool. Unlike the mandatory RLS
layer (see ``rls.py``), which PostgreSQL enforces, this resolves what a request
may read, write or own from the ``resource_grants`` rows on a resource.

Postgres decides. The guild-schema policies apply the sharing rule to every
content table — gate 4, rendered from ``app/db/initiative_rls.py`` and calling
``resource_access`` — and what a request may do to a row beyond reading it is
the schema's own ``resource_actions``, read off the loaded row by
:func:`actions_of`. What is left here names and composes those answers:

  - :func:`require_access` — a *named* refusal on a loaded row, for an
    action ``resource_actions`` did not answer yes to
  - :func:`client_access` — the row's ``can``, the same answer
  - :func:`granted_scope_clause` — deliberately NARROWER than the policy for a
    list spanning initiatives (no guild-admin leg)
  - :func:`writable_scope_clause` — "which of these may I change", which a read
    policy does not answer

Guild isolation and initiative membership are separate layers, in ``rls.py`` and
Postgres.
