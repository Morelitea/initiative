"""Every socket a guild page holds open, in one register.

A guild page opens up to three kinds of socket: the events bus
(``/c/{guild}/events/updates``), a change signal for one queue or counter group
(``/c/{guild}/{tool}/{id}/ws``) and a collaboration room for one document body.
They differ in what they carry. What they share is everything else, and that
lives here once:

* **Rooms.** A socket sits in a set of rooms, each ``(guild_id, kind, id)``. The
  guild id is part of every key: content ids are per-schema sequences and
  collide across guilds, so a bare id would reach the wrong community. The
  events bus sits in its guild's room and in one room per initiative it may
  read; a tool socket sits in its tool's room; a collaboration socket in its
  body's.
* **Admission is the re-check.** Each socket is registered with the function
  that decided which rooms it may be in. The same function runs again on every
  re-check, and what it returns *replaces* the socket's rooms — so a room is
  left as surely as it is entered, and there is no second rule for staying.
  ``None`` (or nothing) disconnects.
* **Continuous re-authorization.** Removing someone from a guild or an
  initiative re-checks their sockets at once (``revoke_user``); a change to
  one resource's sharing re-checks that room (``recheck_room``); everything
  else is caught by the loop every ``REAUTH_INTERVAL_SECONDS``. The credential
  the socket was opened with is re-checked too: ending a sign-in
  (``revoke_user_everywhere``) closes the sockets that sign-in opened, with
  ``WS_CREDENTIAL_ENDED``, and leaves the account's others open.
* **One writer per socket.** Every frame to a registered socket goes through
  its own bounded outbox, drained by its own task. Fan-out puts a frame in
  each outbox and returns, so one slow reader never holds up a room; a reader
  that falls ``OUTBOX_LIMIT`` frames behind is closed and reconnects.

A re-check groups sockets by the account, guild and sign-in that opened them,
and runs one guild entry per group on one session — a person with a board, a
queue and a document open costs one entry, not three — with at most
``RECHECK_CONCURRENCY`` groups in flight.

What this holds is one process's own sockets. Where the API runs as several
workers each holds a share; the events bus reaches every worker because the
room sink reads the change log, not because anything here is shared.
