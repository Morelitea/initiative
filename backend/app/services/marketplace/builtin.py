"""The listings this build ships with.

One JSON file per listing under ``app/marketplace_catalog/``, loaded and upserted
into the catalog at boot. No network: a FOSS install has a working marketplace
out of the box, and a remote registry (later) adds to the same tables through the
same validator rather than a parallel path.

Seeding is idempotent and runs on the system engine. A file that fails validation
is logged and skipped — one malformed listing must not take the rest of the
catalog, or the boot, with it.

Seeding is also what *removes* a shipped listing. The files are the whole truth
about what this build offers, so anything in the catalog under ``builtin`` that
no longer has a file is withdrawn on the next boot. Without that a listing
dropped from the build stays on the shelf of every database that ever saw it.
Withdrawn is not deleted: a guild that already installed it keeps its app.
