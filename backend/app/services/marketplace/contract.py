"""The app contract, as this build reads it.

The vocabulary an app manifest draws on — every enum, cap and character set —
and the shape it takes are declared once, in the ``initiative-app-kit``
repository, in ``manifest.contract.json``. That file is vendored here under
``backend/vendor/app-kit`` at a pinned kit version and read at import.

**Why the kit owns it.** An app author writes against the kit: its types, its
offline validator, its published JSON Schema. When the vocabulary lived here and
the kit's types were written by hand beside a schema fetched from this
repository, the two drifted — the kit could not declare a block this build
accepts. One document, generated into both representations, is what removes
that.

**Why this build still pins it.** ``normalize_service_app_definition`` is
admission control: it decides what a publisher may install. A deployment
therefore reads a copy it shipped with, never one fetched at run time, and a new
contract reaches it when it next releases. So the direction is asymmetric on
purpose — a kit release reaches app authors immediately and this build at its
next release — and a term the vendored contract declares that this build does
not act on is a failing test (:mod:`contract_coverage_test`), not a value
quietly dropped.

Refresh the vendored copy with ``python scripts/refresh_app_kit.py``.
