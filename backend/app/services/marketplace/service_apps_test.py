"""Listing content is data here, and this is the test that keeps it that way.

A service app ships ``module_source``: the JavaScript its widget renders with.
This build's only jobs are to measure it, store it, and hand it to the browser,
where it runs inside the zero-capability sandbox every widget uses. Nothing on
the server parses, compiles, imports, or evaluates it — and "nothing does" is
easy to believe and easy to lose, because it would take one convenience helper
to change.

So it is asserted structurally: every module in this package is parsed, and any
call that could turn stored text into behaviour fails this test. A new one has
to be argued for in review rather than merged quietly.

The same guard covers the rest of a manifest for the same reason — sample rows,
the automation block, and a widget's meta are all publisher-supplied text this
build stores without interpreting.
