"""What a profile-pack listing is allowed to publish.

A pack is a set of profile decorations sold together — a banner, a frame, the
trophy its community recognises. The listing carries the words (name, publisher,
description) like any other; this validates the part that is particular to a
pack: which decorations it grants, and which slot each one goes in.

A decoration is an **id**. The client ships art for the ids this build knows;
a pack from anywhere else carries its own, as an ``image`` per decoration: a
picture in the marketplace's own media, named by the path it is served from.
The owner uploads it for a listing file, and a registry's index names it for
the refresh to copy. A decoration with neither is drawn only where the client
has art for its id.
