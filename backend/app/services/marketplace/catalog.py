"""Reading and populating the marketplace catalog.

Two audiences, and the split between them is the security shape of this module:

* **Readers** — every browse and detail query, and the listing lookup an install
  does. These run on whatever session the request already has (a platform tier,
  or a guild role), and touch nothing but the two catalog tables.
* **The writer** — ``upsert_listing``, called only from the system-engine path
  (boot seeding today, the registry refresh later). No user request reaches it.

Everything a publisher supplies is validated before it lands: the uid's shape,
the ``public_id``'s, the version string's, the attribution, and the definition's
— the last by the same validator the guild-scoped API uses.

Two of those checks are about *who* rather than *what*. Attribution is required,
so nothing is published anonymously; and the ``core.*`` namespace is refused to
any source but this build, so an id cannot imply a provenance the listing does
not have.
