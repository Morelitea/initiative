"""The plug-in API contract this build serves, and whether a plug-in can run on it.

A plug-in shares one thing with Initiative: a version of the plug-in SDK. The
SDK publishes the plug-in API's OpenAPI document at its own version, and a
plug-in's client is generated from that document, never from an Initiative
release. So the **contract version is the SDK's version**, and what this build
serves is the SDK version it vendors (``backend/vendor/plugin-kit/KIT_VERSION``):
:data:`PLUGIN_API_VERSION`, which is the plug-in document's ``info.version``.

A listing may say which contract it needs, as ``min_plugin_api``
(``MAJOR.MINOR``). A build serving ``S`` runs a plug-in needing ``N`` when they
share a major and ``S`` is at least ``N``'s minor: a minor only adds, and a
major removes or changes. A listing that says nothing runs anywhere.
