"""The marketplace registry client: a TUF repository, verified here.

The registry is a TUF repository on a static host (python-tuf ``ngclient``).
This deployment trusts one root: the one shipped in the image at
``app/marketplace/root.json``, or the file ``MARKETPLACE_REGISTRY_ROOT`` names.
Everything else is verified from it. The host serving the files holds no key,
and nothing it serves is used until the metadata chain above it verifies.

**One refresh.**

1. Load the verified top-level metadata this deployment kept
   (``marketplace_tuf_metadata``) into a scratch directory, and hand it to an
   ``Updater`` bootstrapped from the trusted root. The client replays any root
   rotation from there and refuses a repository that is older than what it
   already verified, expired, or signed by keys the chain does not name.
2. Each delegation of the top-level ``targets`` role is a publisher, named by
   its prefix. The client cannot list a delegated role's targets, so each
   publisher's role is loaded by asking for a listing path under it that
   cannot exist, and its targets are read from the copy the client verified
   and kept. Every ``publishers/<prefix>/<uid>/listing.json`` found is then
   resolved again through the client's own delegation search, so a role only
   supplies paths its delegation covers.
3. Read each listing and the files it names into memory. Nothing is written to
   disk but metadata, and each file is checked against its target metadata
   before it is read.
4. Apply each listing in its own savepoint
   (:mod:`app.services.marketplace.registry_entries`), withdraw what the
   repository no longer lists, and store the metadata the client verified.

The catalog moves as one transaction. A refusal of the repository itself
(unreachable, expired, not verifying) rolls it back and records the code on the
status row, so the last verified catalog stays exactly as it was.

**An uploaded bundle** (a tar of the repository's ``metadata/`` and
``targets/`` directories) goes through the same code with a fetcher that reads
the archive instead of the network.

**Not configured** means this build ships no trusted root yet: the shipped file
is a placeholder (a JSON object with a ``placeholder`` member). No worker runs
and the endpoints say so.

``session`` is a system-engine session throughout: the catalog, publishers and
registrations have no request-path writer.
