"""A vendor's own flow for making an app's vendor client.

An app's manifest may declare ``vendor.setup``: a flow at the vendor that
creates the client the app's connections use on this deployment, and answers
with its values. Initiative runs it from the operator's browser and writes the
answers into the registration's vendor values through the write the settings
form uses, so none is typed or copied.

``github_app_manifest`` is the one flow. GitHub creates a GitHub App from a
manifest the browser posts to it, sends the operator back with a code, and
exchanges that code once for the new app's id, slug, client id and secret,
webhook secret and private key.

* :func:`start` builds the manifest, the app's own declaration with the
  addresses Initiative already knows filled in, and a state for the operator's
  browser to carry to GitHub and back.
* :func:`complete` checks the state, exchanges the code, and writes each value
  to the vendor field the manifest names.

The state seals what the setup was started with: the registration, its
listing and listing version, and which vendor field each answer is written to.
It is recorded as an ``auth_challenges`` row naming the operator who started
the setup, answered by the registration it is for. It lasts an hour, and the
first completion by that operator for that registration spends it.
