"""The listings this build ships, and which of them a deployment offers.

Two things are worth pinning down here.

The first is that every shipped manifest actually lands. Seeding logs a bad
manifest and moves on — the right call at boot, since one broken file must not
take the catalog with it, but it means a packaging mistake is silent. It was:
a listing shipped with a uid outside the alphabet and never appeared in the
catalog at all, and nothing failed. So the manifests are seeded here for real
and the result is counted.

The second is that the files are the whole truth. A listing dropped from the
build has to leave the shelf everywhere, or it lingers in the catalog of every
database that ever saw it — which is exactly what happened when the advanced
tool was removed and its listing stayed, offered, alongside its replacement.
Withdrawing has to be careful in the other direction too: a file this build
ships but cannot read or validate must never take its own listing down.
