"""Dashboards an app ships with itself.

A publisher who declares widgets otherwise leaves every guild to arrange them.
The point of bundling is that the operator adds one file and the arrangements
come with it — so what these check is mostly about *identity and lifecycle*: the
derived listing is an ordinary one, it is the publisher's own uid rather than
anything invented here, and it lives and dies with the app that supplied it.

The one case worth reading first is the last: a bundled dashboard is offered
only where its app is installed, and that has to be decided at install and not
only in the browse response, because a uid seen in one guild is otherwise just
as installable in the next.
