"""What a widget calls itself — the server-side reading of the same rules.

A widget module exports ``meta`` alongside ``render``, carrying its name, its
description, and the labels for its own options in every language its author
supports. The browser reads that meta out of the sandbox and rebuilds it with
``validateWidgetMeta`` (``frontend/src/lib/widgets/widgetMeta.ts``); a listing
carries the same structure as plain data, and this module is where that data is
checked before it is stored.

**Two implementations, one set of numbers.** The implementations exist because
they run in different places on different inputs — one on a sandbox return
value, one on catalog content — and neither can call the other. That much is
irreducible. The limits they trim by are not: both read them from the vendored
app-kit contract, so there is nothing here to keep in step with the mirror and
no way for a widget to be accepted by the catalog and then re-trimmed
differently in the browser.

Rebuilt from checked parts rather than inspected in place: unknown keys, unusable
locales, and over-long strings are dropped by construction, so what is stored is
exactly what can be rendered.
