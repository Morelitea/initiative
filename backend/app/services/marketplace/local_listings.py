"""What a deployment adds to its own marketplace.

A deployment's marketplace is the catalogue it was shipped and the registries it
trusts, plus what it adds itself: ``local`` listings. Two ways in:

* **A member shares an item.** The item is exported, stripped to what belongs
  to the work (``publish_profile``), and submitted. Unless the owner lets
  members publish directly, it waits for the owner's review, stored but not
  offered.
* **The owner uploads a listing file** — the same manifest a catalog
  directory or a registry carries — and it is published as it is.

A ``local`` listing is a plain catalogue row, deployment-wide like every other.
Nothing is signed, and there is no file or index behind it, so no sweep of the
other sources ever retires one; it is taken down by the member who shared it,
or refused by the owner before it is ever offered.

Every write here runs on the system engine: the catalogue has no request-path
writer. The member's own export runs before, on their own session.
