"""JSONata, as Initiative evaluates a declarative app's expressions.

Standard JSONata (``jsonata-python``, a port of the reference implementation),
with no functions added, answering what the SDK's ``evaluate`` answers: the
same three bounds from the same contract, ``expressionTimeMs``,
``expressionDepth`` and ``expressionOutputBytes``, and ``$now()`` and
``$millis()`` fixed to the time of the call. Passing a bound is a failure, as
an expression that raises an error is (:class:`ExpressionError`).

**Where it runs.** The library checks the time and depth bounds between
evaluation steps, as the reference implementation does. One step can still run
long on its own (a regular expression, a large ``$pad``), so evaluations run in
worker processes (:mod:`app.services.jsonata_pool`), and one still busy after
the time bound and a grace period is stopped and replaced. The pool starts on
the first evaluation, holds at most ``EXPRESSION_WORKERS`` per process, and a
worker idle for ``_IDLE_SECONDS`` exits. Parsing, which publishing a manifest
needs, runs here.

An answer comes back as plain JSON, or :data:`UNDEFINED` when the expression
answers nothing.
