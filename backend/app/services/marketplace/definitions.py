"""What a listing is allowed to publish, per kind.

A listing arriving from anywhere — a shipped data file today, an operator upload
or a signed remote manifest later — carries a definition, and that definition is
stored and later copied into a guild's schema. This module is the one place that
decides whether a body is acceptable, and for a tool's listing it does so by
handing off to *that tool's importer*: a listing is the tool's export envelope,
held to the same checks as importing the same file (``tool_listings``), and a
dashboard's canvas to the same widget validator the guild-scoped API uses.

That reuse is the point: catalog content is held to the same vocabulary as
anything authored or imported in the app, by the same code.

The pieces this file leans on live beside it, because a service plug-in's manifest is
too large a vocabulary to read in one sitting:

* ``manifest_values`` — the bounded primitives every value goes through.
* ``widget_meta`` — the server-side reading of the rules the browser applies to
  a widget's own strings.
* ``service_plugins`` — the ``plugin_kind: "service"`` manifest.

Two rules span all of them. **Attribution is required**: a listing states who
wrote it or it is not published. And **``core.*`` belongs to this repository**:
an id in that namespace is only ever claimed by a listing shipped in this build.

#: The tool marketplaces: one per tool that exports and imports, keyed by the
#: tool's own value. A listing of one of these kinds is that tool's export
#: envelope, and installing it is that tool's import, so a tool gets a
#: marketplace by having an exporter and an importer, which it needs anyway
#: (``tools_test`` holds the two together).
TOOL_LISTING_KINDS: dict[str, Tool] = {tool.value: tool for tool in BULK_EXPORT_TOOLS}

#: Kinds the catalog can hold: the tool marketplaces, plus the three that are
#: not a tool's content.
#:
#: ``auto`` is declared here so the vocabulary is complete — the marketplace can
#: name and filter by it — while nothing installs one yet: a manifest carrying
#: one is refused with a reason rather than stored as something no code can
#: resolve.
#:
#: ``profile_pack`` installs to a *person* rather than a guild — the decorations
#: it grants land in an account's own library. It is the one kind that does, and
#: the catalog does not need to know: publishing, browsing and versioning are
#: the same for it as for anything else, and only the install path differs.
LISTING_KINDS: frozenset[str] = frozenset(

#: Who a listing installs to.
#:
#: Every kind but one installs to a **guild** — a tool's content lands in an
#: initiative, a plug-in mounts in a community. A profile pack installs to a
#: **user**: its decorations land in one account's own library and belong to
#: that person across every community they are in.
#:
#: The distinction is not cosmetic. It decides which marketplace offers a
#: listing, who is allowed to install it, and what "installed" is even recorded
#: against — so it is declared once, here, beside the kinds themselves.

#: How a listing reached this deployment. Not a trust ranking shown to a reader
#: — every listing is here because whoever runs this server put it here — but the reason
#: a listing shipped in this build is credited to us rather than to whatever its
#: manifest claims.
#:
#: ``builtin`` shipped in this build. ``operator`` was read from the catalog
#: directory whoever runs the deployment mounts. ``registry`` arrived from a
#: remote index this deployment trusts. ``local`` was added here and nowhere
#: else — shared by a member, or uploaded by the operator — and has no file or
#: index behind it, so no sweep of those sources ever retires it.

#: The source a deployment's own additions publish under.
LOCAL_SOURCE = "local"

#: How a plug-in presents itself.
#:
#: ``tool_instance`` mounts one of the plug-in's own tools at guild scope — the plug-in
#: creates an ordinary row in an ordinary table and the existing UI renders it.
#: ``embed`` hosts an external surface in an iframe, driven by the signed handoff
#: machinery. ``service`` declares features a container the operator runs will
#: serve.
PLUGIN_KINDS: frozenset[str] = frozenset({"tool_instance", "service"})

#: The plug-in kinds the guild install path can mount.
#:
#: All three, now that a ``service`` plug-in has somewhere to land: the deployment's
#: registration supplies the address, the secret and the powers, and the install
#: is the pinned definition plus whatever the guild configures against it. A
#: service plug-in creates no local content, so installing one is the row and
#: nothing else.
#:
#: The set is still separate from :data:`PLUGIN_KINDS` because the two answer
#: different questions — what a listing may *declare* versus what this build can
#: *mount* — and a kind added to the vocabulary ahead of its machinery is
#: refused by name rather than half-mounted.
GUILD_INSTALLABLE_PLUGIN_KINDS: frozenset[str] = frozenset({"tool_instance", "service"})

#: Tools a plug-in may mount at guild scope. A tool qualifies when its content is
