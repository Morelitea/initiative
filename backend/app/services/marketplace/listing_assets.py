"""The pictures a listing uses: uploaded to the marketplace, and copied into
the community that installs it.

A listing's pictures are never taken from a community. What a community stores
is its own, whoever is sharing from it, so a share reads nothing from its
storage and the publish profile drops every reference into it. A picture a
listing shows is one somebody **uploaded to the marketplace** for it: a
member's images when they share, or the files the owner uploads for a listing
of their own. Each is a new file in the marketplace's media (``media``), named
by the digest of its bytes.

Installing copies each picture the listing names into the installing
community's storage as a new upload of the member installing, and names the
copy there. That is how an owner-published gallery arrives with its pictures.
