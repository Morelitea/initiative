"""The tool marketplaces: a listing is a tool's export envelope, and installing
it is that tool's import.

Every tool that exports and imports has a marketplace (``TOOL_LISTING_KINDS``).
No second format exists beside the envelope: what a listing version stores is
the envelope the tool's exporter writes, held to the tool's own importer, and
installing it runs that importer into an initiative as the member who asked —
under RLS, with the importer's own permission check, exactly as importing the
same file would.

Three things a listing stores differ from a file on disk:

* **The listing names the item.** An installed copy is called what the listing
  is called, whatever name the envelope carries, so the thing a member picked
  from the shelf is the thing that appears in their initiative.
* **What belongs to the community stays behind** — people, links out of the
  item, uploads — and dates become offsets from a fixed day
  (``publish_profile``). That applies to a listing from any source, so an
  install never names somebody or points somewhere in the installer's
  community by accident.
* **A listing may carry an example** beside what it installs: the same tool's
  envelope, filled in. A tool made of queries over a community's data does not
  take one from its publisher (``example_is_generated`` on the exporter); its
  preview data is generated instead.

Nothing here decides who may read the catalog or write it. Normalization runs
wherever a listing is ingested (the catalog's writer); installing runs on the
guild-routed session of the member installing.
