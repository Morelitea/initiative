"""The DAC engine, asked the way a request asks it.

The rung a request holds on a row is the database's answer — the schema's
``resource_level``, mapped on every shareable model as ``access_level`` — so
every case here loads the row on the request login, routed through the seam
as the reader, through the loader the endpoints use. ``resource_level_test``
holds that function to the sharing gate, standing by standing. What this
file holds is what the app layer still decides on top of the level: the
named refusal, the frozen caps, the clauses a list spanning initiatives
adds, and the audience a notice reaches.
