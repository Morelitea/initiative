"""Read a table's fields off the table.

A model already says almost everything a filter needs to know. A foreign key
names the table it points at, which is what decides the picker — an integer that
references ``users`` is a person, not a number. A SQL ``Enum`` carries its own
values, so a closed vocabulary needs no second copy. A column's SQL type says
whether it orders, and whether it can be compared at all.

So none of that is declared per dataset here. A dataset names its model and the
handful of things a table genuinely cannot say — which columns are a feature's
private state, and which fields are computed rather than stored — and gets the
rest. That is what keeps the second dataset from costing what the first one did.
