"""The task dataset — what a table cannot say about a task.

The columns are not here. They are read off ``Task`` itself, because a foreign
key already names the picker that fills it and a SQL type already says whether
it orders. What is left is the part no table carries: the five fields that are a
subquery rather than a column, and the two columns that exist for a feature's
own bookkeeping.
