"""The registry expresses what the task filter path already did.

This phase re-points an existing surface at a new declaration, so the only
interesting question is whether anything changed. Two halves answer it: the set
of filterable names has to match what the endpoint's builder produced, and each
virtual field has to compile to the same clause it always did.

The endpoint tests are the other half — they exercise these fields through real
requests, and they were not touched.
