"""What a field *is* — one declaration, read by every surface that names one.

A :class:`FieldSpec` says everything about a field once: how it resolves to SQL,
what kind of value it holds, which operators apply, and which control fills it.
That last one is what lets a filter UI be generic instead of carrying a branch
per field.

It is a *description*, not a second validator. ``apply_filters`` still owns how a
clause is assembled and ``parse_conditions`` still owns the payload limits;
restating either here would mean maintaining them twice.

Nothing in this module imports a model, so it stays cheap to import from
anywhere and a dataset declaration can live beside the thing it describes.
