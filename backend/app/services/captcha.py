"""Server-side verification for the registration captcha.

Three providers are supported, selected via the ``CAPTCHA_PROVIDER``
env var:

  - ``"hcaptcha"``    → https://hcaptcha.com/
  - ``"turnstile"``   → Cloudflare Turnstile
  - ``"recaptcha"``   → Google reCAPTCHA v2/v3 (verify endpoint is
                        the same for both versions; v3 score is not
                        gated here — set a low threshold via the
                        provider's own console if you need one).

All three accept the same form-encoded POST shape (``secret``,
``response``, optional ``remoteip``) and return JSON with
``success: bool``. The helper is provider-agnostic above that.

Silent disable: with no provider or no secret configured,
``verify_or_raise`` is a no-op so registration works exactly as
before. The register endpoint also short-circuits on the
bootstrap-first-user path so a fresh deployment isn't blocked by a
captcha it hasn't been told to require.

Where the configuration comes from: ``app.services.captcha_config``,
which resolves the settings row and the stored secret and falls back
to the ``CAPTCHA_*`` env values before the first database load. The
env vars are a first-boot seed now, not the configuration itself --
an owner changes any of this in Settings without a redeploy.
