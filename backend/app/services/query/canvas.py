"""A dashboard's query widgets, compiled into one statement.

A canvas asks many questions of the same few datasets. Asked one at a time,
every widget scans those tables and answers their policies for every row
again. Compiled, each dataset two or more widgets read is read **once**, into
a materialized CTE that carries the same name as the table, and every widget
runs over those rows:

.. code-block:: sql

    WITH tasks AS MATERIALIZED (SELECT id, title, … FROM tasks)
    SELECT (SELECT json_agg(ROW(q.*)) FROM (SELECT * FROM (<widget>) AS w
            LIMIT 5001) AS q) AS w0,
           …

The widget statements are placed as the resolver wrote them. A non-recursive
CTE's name is not visible inside its own body, so the body reads the table
while every widget beside it reads the CTE. A dataset only one widget reads is
left alone, so that widget keeps the table's indexes.

The inputs are :class:`~app.services.query.resolve.ResolvedQuery` values:
statements the resolver has already admitted and written out from its own tree.
Nothing here reads a reader's text.
