"""Run a resolved query, inside everything that bounds it.

A statement arrives here already read, validated and rewritten
(:mod:`app.services.query.resolve`). What happens here is the running of it:
under which role, in which transaction, against which limits.

Five things bound a query, and they are independent of each other:

* a **pool of its own**, so these statements wait for each other rather than
  for the requests serving every other page;
* a **cap per guild** on how many run at once, held in the database so it is
  the whole deployment's cap rather than each process's;
* a **read-only transaction**, which refuses a write whatever the statement
  says;
* the **query role**, which holds ``SELECT`` and no more;
* **statement limits** — a time bound, a memory bound, no parallel workers —
  and a **planner estimate** checked before anything runs.

The last one is the only one that can refuse a statement that is otherwise
perfectly legal, and it does so without executing it.
