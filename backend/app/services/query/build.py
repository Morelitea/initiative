"""Turn a structured description of a query into SQL.

The builder in the browser does not write SQL. It describes what somebody
clicked — a dataset, some columns, a filter, a grouping — and this writes the
statement, by building the parse tree and handing it to the same deparser that
writes every other statement this surface produces.

That is the whole reason it lives here rather than in the client. A statement a
person built by clicking must be one the validator accepts, and the two ways to
get that wrong are quoting and spelling: a name or a literal written into SQL by
hand has to be escaped exactly the way Postgres reads it, and a clause has to be
spelled the way the grammar expects. Building the tree settles both — there is
no string to escape, and a node that would not parse cannot be constructed.

The cutover migration writes its statements through the same functions, so the
SQL a stored definition was rewritten to and the SQL the builder produces are
the same SQL.
