"""Whether a message actually reaches a phone nobody is looking at.

The bell line and the email are covered next door, in ``dm_notifications_test``.
This file is about the third channel, which is the only one that works when the
app is closed — and about the join it depends on, which is the part that had
nothing holding it up.

A push reaches an installation only where two rows agree about which one it is:
the account's message key store (``dm_devices``) and its push registration
(``push_tokens``) both have to name the same device token. Neither row was ever
written with one, so the sets never intersected and every direct-message push
was dropped before it was built. The assertions here are the ones that fail if
either half stops being recorded.
