"""Binding a stream to a project, and setting one up from a blueprint.

The platform holds one pointer — ``app_settings.operations_guild_id`` — and
everything else is ordinary per-guild config inside the guild it names. This
module is what the owner's settings page calls to read and change both.

Every write here is the platform owner's (``config.manage``): binding a stream
is deployment configuration of the same class as OIDC, SMTP and branding.
Reaching the guild's own schema is a system session from the guild's cohort
routed into it by the guild alone, the same way every other platform surface
that reads guild rows does.
