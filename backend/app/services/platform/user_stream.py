"""The per-user channel, and the bus behind it.

How a frame reaches every tab one person has open, wherever they are —
including from a worker that is not the one holding the socket. The sockets
themselves are the account sockets in :mod:`app.services.content_sockets`,
each in its account's room with its own outbox, so a send here is an enqueue
and never waits on a reader.

Four channels sit on this: :mod:`~app.services.platform.notification_stream`
(the inbox moved), :mod:`~app.services.platform.account_stream` (your standing
changed), :mod:`~app.services.platform.contacts_stream` and
:mod:`~app.services.platform.dm_stream`. They send the same shape and none owns
the machinery, so there is one place to look when a frame does not arrive.

Every frame is a **content-free invalidation signal**: it says something you can
already read has changed, never what it now says. The client refetches through
the ordinary authorized endpoint, and that request is the only decision point.
So the worst a routing mistake here can do is cost somebody a wasted refetch.

Delivery is two paths, and the split is deliberate:

* **Local** — this worker's own sockets, always, straight from the hook that
  runs once the writing transaction commits.
* **Cross-process** — ``pg_notify`` on a dedicated connection, picked up by
  every other worker's listener. One notice names every reader a frame is for
  (up to ``IDS_PER_NOTICE``), so a transaction that signals a whole
  community's members costs a few notices, not one per member.

The local path is what makes this fail-soft. Where the bus cannot be reached the
cross-process half is simply absent and everything behaves as it did before it
existed; nothing waits on it and nothing breaks when it is missing. Each process
stamps frames with its own ``origin`` and skips its own on the way back in, so
the two paths never deliver twice.

**A bus that was down is a gap in both directions**, and coming back up is the
only notice of it. So ``on_bus_connected`` does two things: it sends the frames
whose cross-process half was refused while the bus was away — content-free, so
a user with fifty missed frames is one frame — and it tells this process's own
sockets to re-read everything, because what they missed while nothing was
listening here is not knowable. That is what lets the client hold no timer of
its own for the connected case.
