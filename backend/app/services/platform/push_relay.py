"""This server's registration with BeyondersStudio's push relay.

The relay sends pushes to the official app for any server: iPhone pushes
always, and Android pushes for a server with no Firebase service account of
its own. Its send call is FCM's own, so ``push_notifications`` builds the same
message either way and only the address and the credential differ.

A server registers once (``POST /v1/servers``) and is issued an id and a key.
They are kept beside the service account on ``app_setting_secrets`` (the key
Fernet-encrypted), read and written on the system engine, and cached in this
process. Registering happens when the app first asks for the push settings
(``GET /settings/fcm-config``) or on the first push that needs the relay,
whichever comes first, so a server whose operator never switches push on
never contacts it.

A server never holds a device's own token for a relay platform. The app
registers that token with the relay for this server's id and is given a
*handle* (``rh_`` and 43 base64url characters), which is what it registers
here and what a send names. A handle reaches only the device that chose this
server, and the relay answers ``404`` for one it does not know, so the row is
deleted like any other dead token. A new registration means a new id: the
app sees it in the push settings on its next launch and asks for a new handle.
