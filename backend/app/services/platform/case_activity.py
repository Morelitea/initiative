"""What the platform writes on an operations case, as the case goes on.

A case is a task, and its comments are its history. Most of that history is
people working it; the rest is the platform noting what happened around it — a
report seen again, and in later phases a reply from whoever filed it, a grant
issued against it, a rule tripping again. This module is the one writer of
those notes, so every kind is worded in one place and every note looks alike.

A note is an ordinary comment with no author and a ``system_kind`` naming what
wrote it. That is what tells it from a comment an installed plug-in wrote, which
names no author either. Notes are said to the case's members only: nothing the
platform notes reaches the person who filed the case.

Notes carry ids, counts and what somebody typed into the filing itself —
never content read out of another community.
