"""Connections and message requests — what two accounts have agreed.

Both live in ``contact_grants``, one row per unordered pair per kind, and they
do different jobs. A **connection** satisfies every ``DmPolicy`` and opens
nothing on its own; an accepted **message** grant is what opens the channel.
So a pair on ``private`` needs both.

Two rules here are worth finding when you come back to this module:

* ``initial_message_state`` — a message grant between connected accounts starts
  accepted. That is a statement about what a connection currently *means*, not
  about messaging, and it is the one place to delete when a connection carries
  anything else.
* ``revoke_stale_message_grants`` — a grant lives only while the pair could ask
  each other today. Five events take a leg of ``can_ask`` away, and all five
  run the same test rather than each carrying a rule of its own.
