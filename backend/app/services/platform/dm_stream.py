"""The direct-message channel on the per-user signal socket.

The third channel over the shared transport, built like
:mod:`app.services.platform.account_stream`. Frames carry **nothing** — not a
conversation id, not a sender, not a count. A tab that receives one fetches its
queue through the ordinary authorized endpoint and decrypts locally, so that
request is the only place anything is decided and a frame delivered to the wrong
socket would tell its reader nothing.

A separate channel rather than an arm on ``contacts``: a contacts frame means
"re-read three permission lists", and a mailbox poll should not ride behind it.
