"""Telling somebody that somebody else is asking to reach them.

Four moments, one per direction of the two grants: a connection asked for and
answered, and permission to message asked for and answered. Each is a decision
waiting on a person, which is the whole reason they are worth interrupting for
-- a request nobody is told about sits in a list nobody opens, and the account
that sent it is left reading silence as a refusal.

Unlike a message, none of this is opaque to the server: a grant row names both
parties in the clear. So these carry the other account's handle and push to
every installation, not only the ones holding a message key store -- there is
nothing here to decrypt.

This runs on the system engine rather than the actor's session. Writing a
notification and reading push tokens are both things the recipient's account
owns, and the account doing the asking has no business reaching either.
