"""The windows a deleted account, a deleted community and a held community wait
out before the hourly sweep acts on them.

A window is a status on a row, the ``status_changed_at`` stamp written when the
row entered it, and the deployment setting that says how many days it lasts
(``None`` where nothing acts on a timer). :class:`RetentionWindow` answers from
those three alone when a row's window ends, which rows are due, and runs the
sweep that takes each due row in turn.
