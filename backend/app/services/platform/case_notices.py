"""Telling the people who work the operations community's cases that work
has arrived: a case opened, or its requester answered on one nobody has taken.

Both go to everyone who can read the case — the people its project is shared
with and the community's admins — because until somebody takes it, nobody in
particular is answering it. A stream kept to an initiative of its own is told
only to that initiative, since nobody else can read it. Each person can turn
the ``cases`` category down.

Both ride the caller's transaction, on the session routed into the operations
community, and never commit. :func:`works_cases` says who can hear them, so
the settings page offers the category only to them.
