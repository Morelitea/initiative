Two halves that do not share a source. The **sections** are the rosters of the
reader's own guilds, gathered the way every other ``/me`` aggregate is — one
routed visit per guild, via ``gather_across_guilds``. The **favorites** are
rows of ``public.profile_favorites`` resolved against ``public.user_profiles``,
which needs no guild at all and may name people the reader shares none with.
