"""Counting what the security rules watch, and opening a case when one trips.

Every audit line passes :func:`observe` on its way out (``app.services.audit``),
and every counted rejection passes :func:`signal`. Each is one dict lookup —
most find no rule — and, for a match, an increment of a bucket held in this
process. Nothing is written per event, so an attack costs no writes.

Every :data:`FLUSH_INTERVAL`, :func:`flush` adds each rule's buckets into
``security_signal_windows`` in one statement, which returns the deployment's
totals across every instance. A window whose total has just reached its rule's
threshold is stamped — by exactly one instance — and that instance writes one
``security.threshold_crossed`` line and opens (or adds to) the rule's security
case for that key. A crash loses at most one interval of counts; the audit log
stays the record of the events themselves.

Keys never leave memory as they were: the table holds an HMAC of each, and the
threshold line, which is the audit record, names what was counted.
