"""What a notification may leave the app carrying.

Three answers, each asked once of the deployment and once of the community the
notification belongs to, and resolved by taking the stricter of the pair:

``push``
    May it reach a phone. Off, nothing is sent to the device estate at all.

``email``
    May it reach a mailbox. The *notification* half of email only — a sign-in
    code, an address to confirm, a password reset and the notices an account
    gets about itself are not notifications and are unaffected.

``redact``
    May what it says name the thing it is about. Set, a notification that leaves
    the app reduces to the kind of thing that happened, and the app is where the
    rest of it is. The bell inside the app says everything either way.

Two levels because two parties know the answer. A deployment that is one
organisation is configured by its operator, once, for everybody on it; a
community sharing a deployment with others answers for itself. Either may
restrict; neither may relax what the other restricted.

A notification that belongs to no community — a direct message, a connection
request, a notice about an account — is answered by the deployment alone.

Read on the system engine, like the recipient's own settings next door: what
may leave is the deployment's answer and the community's, not a question for
whichever session happens to be sending.
