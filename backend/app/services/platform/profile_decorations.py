One function answers it — :func:`owned_decorations` — over two sources: what
ships with the app, which everyone has, and what the account acquired, which is
a row in ``public.user_decorations``. Every caller goes through it, so the
picker offers exactly what the write path accepts.

that ship with this build differ from a published one only by ``source``, and
what a granted row records is the listing's ``uid`` — the one name that means
