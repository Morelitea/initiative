"""Carrying a nudge between workers, over Postgres.

The API may run as more than one process. A signal raised by the worker that
handled a request has to reach the worker holding the socket it is for, and
those are routinely not the same one. Postgres itself raises some of them: the
change-capture trigger says a guild's log has moved without any worker being
involved at all.

One held connection carries every channel — a subscriber registers a handler,
and the listener is (re)established for all of them together. So a second kind
of nudge costs a channel name and a function, never a second connection.

This uses ``LISTEN``/``NOTIFY``, which is already deployed everywhere the app
is: no broker to run, no port to open, no credential to rotate, and no second
service between a self-hosted install and its own realtime. It rides the
database connection this codebase has already built its roles and policies
around, which for a bus carrying no content is the whole of what it needs.

Two properties of the mechanism shape the code below:

* **``LISTEN`` is session state.** It belongs to one connection for as long as
  that connection lives, so it cannot come from a transaction pool that hands
  out a different backend each time. This holds its own connection, apart from
  every engine. ``NOTIFY`` has no such constraint — it is an ordinary statement
  — but it is sent on this same connection to keep the whole bus in one place.
* **Delivery is at-most-once and only to whoever is listening now.** There is
  no queue and no replay: a worker that was reconnecting missed what went past.
  That is acceptable precisely because a frame is only ever a nudge to refetch,
  and it is why nothing here is allowed to be load-bearing. A subscriber that
  needs to survive a gap keeps its own backstop — the room sink sweeps the log
  it is nudged about, so a missed hint costs latency rather than the update.

Every failure is therefore soft. Where the bus cannot start, callers still
deliver to their own process's sockets and the deployment behaves exactly as it
did before this existed.
