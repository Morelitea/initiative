"""Telling the person who filed a case that it moved.

A sweep, not a hook: a case moves however its team moves it — a drag on the
board, a bulk edit, a plug-in, a reply — and every one of those already has its
own writer. Once each pass, the sweep reads the cases of the operations
community that have a filer, works out where each stands for its filer the
same way their own view does (:func:`tickets.derive_state`), and compares that
and the newest reply said to them with what they were last told
(``filer_notified_state`` / ``filer_notified_comment_id``). Anything that
moved becomes one notice; the case then records what it told them.

A closed case its filer has already been told about drops out of the scan
unless something new is said to them, so a pass reads the open work, not the
history.
