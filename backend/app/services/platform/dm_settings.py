"""The direct-message policy row that hangs off an account.

One row per account, created with the account. It is seeded here rather than in
each of the three places an account is made — registration, provisioning from
an identity provider, and the bootstrap owner — so the operator's default is
applied wherever an account arrives from.

A missing row still reads as ``private`` in ``public.dm_can_ask``, so a path
that somehow skips this is closed rather than open; what it would lose is the
operator's choice, silently, which is what ``dm_settings_test`` is for.
