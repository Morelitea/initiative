"""An access grant and the operations case it serves.

A support or moderation errand starts as a case in the operations community,
and the access it needs is asked for *for* that case: the request names it,
and the case hears what became of the grant — that it was asked for, how it
was decided, each act taken under it, and what it did, hourly while it is
live and in full once it ends.

What the case is told is ids, counts, route templates and the names of acts,
never anything from the community the grant reaches: the case is read by
staff of the operations community, who may not be cleared for it.

Whoever names a case must be able to read it, as themselves: their own
session, routed into the operations community through the ordinary entry
point, reads it, so a case they cannot see answers exactly as one that does
not exist.
