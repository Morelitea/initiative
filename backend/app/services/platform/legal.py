"""A deployment's own terms, and the record that an account accepted them.

The documents are not in this repository. A deployment that has terms of its
own names an external portal in ``BILLING_URL`` and they are served from
there; unset — the default — and none of this runs: there is nothing to
accept, nothing is recorded, and every route answers 404.

They are read through this module rather than by the browser for three
reasons: the native build's origin is not an ``https://`` one, and a policy
has to be readable from the signup form there too; the server needs the index
anyway, to record *which* revision was accepted; and signing up must not
depend on a browser reaching a second origin.

Nothing here can fail a registration. A portal that cannot be reached leaves
the version and digest unrecorded — the acceptance still happened, and the
portal's own history of the document says what it said on the day.
