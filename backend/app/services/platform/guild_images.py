"""Guild icons and banners: who may see one, and how they are stored.

These are the only guild media a stranger can be shown. A listed guild's icon
and its banner's card rendition appear on its community-directory card, which
is served to any signed-in user; the full banner appears on the guild's own
front page, which is not. That asymmetry is the whole of this module:

    published variants (icon, card) — the guild listed itself, OR you belong
    the rest (full)                 — you belong
    neither                         — nothing exists as far as you are concerned

"belong" throughout includes a live PAM/break-glass grantee, who reaches the
guild for their window exactly as a member does. Which variants are published
is read from ``PUBLISHED_VARIANTS`` rather than restated here, so adding one is
a single edit beside the registry.

The check runs on the system engine for the reason the directory itself does:
the caller is a stranger to the guild, so there is no guild-scoped role to read
it under, and ``public.guilds`` is scoped by RLS to the caller's own
memberships. The request path holds no grant on the image bytes at all — this
function is their only reader, which is why the rule lives here in one piece
rather than spread across the endpoints that serve it.
