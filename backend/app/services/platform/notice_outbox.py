"""Notices: written down in the request, delivered by a worker.

:func:`~app.services.notifications.notify` decides who hears about something
and what it says, and :func:`enqueue` writes one row per recipient in the
caller's transaction. The worker below delivers them: the bell line and the
email in one transaction per recipient, then every push of the pass at once.

Three things follow from the split:

* **Delivery leaves the request path.** A post that reaches a thousand people
  costs its request one insert, not a thousand bell writes and FCM calls.
* **The request that caused a notice is what it rides on.** The rows and the
  wake go out with its commit, so a request that rolls back tells nobody.
* **The bell line and the email are written once.** They are written, and the
  row marked, in one transaction. A push that fails short of an answer is
  tried again later; one that crashes mid-send is sent again after the lease,
  so a push may rarely arrive twice and is never silently lost.
