"""Which ways in this deployment and its communities permit.

The one read of each setting, and the one write. Everything that gates a
sign-in route asks here, so the rules live in exactly one place. (A fresh
deployment's first value is the env's, ``AUTH_LOGIN_METHODS`` — seeded once
into the settings row when it is created, see
``app_settings._seeded_login_methods`` — and every change after that goes
through :func:`change`.)

**Writing a rule.** Every rule about how somebody reaches the deployment or a
community, and what leaves a community on its behalf, is a :class:`Rule` in
:data:`PLATFORM_RULES` or :data:`COMMUNITY_RULES`, and is written by
:func:`change`, which runs the same steps for each:

1. Take the rows a change depends on: the settings row for the deployment's
   rules; the community's row, and while anything tightens, the settings row
   shared and the seat lock.
2. Loosen first. A loosening write only admits more, so it is never refused
   for want of an entitlement or of anything to answer it.
3. Then tighten, each against the state the loosening left. A tightening
   needs the community's entitlement, something the deployment permits that
   can answer it, and a writer who already answers it themselves.
4. Write, and record each rule that moved. One that did not move records
   nothing.
5. Follow up and commit: switching push off drops the tokens it was sent to.

A community's rule applies only while it holds the option the rule needs
(``guild_administration.auth_options``), and every point that enforces
one asks. Taking an option away stops the rule applying and
leaves it set, so it applies again when the option comes back.
