"""Erase accounts whose retention window has run out.

Asking for an account to go no longer erases it: it moves to
``UserStatus.deleted`` and keeps everything — the row, its personal data, its
memberships, its initiative roles, the files it owns — so the person can
come back. Signing in is what brings them back; this worker is what happens if
they do not.

What it runs at the end is :func:`~app.services.platform.users.soft_delete_user`,
unchanged: the erasure that used to happen the moment somebody pressed the
button. Not ``hard_delete_user`` — anonymizing keeps the row, so the work the
account touched still tells one departed author from another.

Polled by ``background_tasks._loop_worker`` once an hour on
``SystemSessionLocal`` (the ``app_admin`` login). ``soft_delete_user`` does
each guild's part on a system session from that guild's cohort, so this session
stays in ``public``.
