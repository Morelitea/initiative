"""Telling whoever runs this server what somebody thinks.

Feedback is one-way until the team answers: a case in the feedback stream that
its sender follows under their tickets, and may write on once the team has
written to them. Where the app was when they sent it travels with it, as they
saw it before sending and could remove: the version, the platform, the
language, the theme, the page's route with every id left out, and the width
of the window.

A problem that needs an answer is not feedback. The sheet sends that to
support instead, before it is filed, so nothing here moves a case between
streams.
