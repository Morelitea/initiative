"""What a notification line is about, read at the moment the line is read.

A notification names the thing it is about — a task, a document, the post
somebody published — and the bell needs that thing's title to say anything
useful. The row itself carries only the identifiers, so the titles are read
here, from the community's own schema, through the same seam a
``/c/{guild_id}`` request goes through.

Reading them rather than storing them is what keeps a line honest: a task
renamed after the mention shows its new name, and a line whose subject the
reader can no longer reach resolves to nothing, which is what the bell renders
as its plain form.
