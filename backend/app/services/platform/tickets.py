"""Filing a ticket: one way in, for every kind of operations work.

A ticket is an intake case — a task in the operations guild — filed by a
person. This module is what every filing surface goes through: it says, per
stream, whether a form can be offered at all, holds each account to the
stream's pace, and hands the filing to the stream that knows what it means.

Where a stream cannot take a filing — nothing is bound to receive it, or the
person is not entitled to file it from where they are — the answer is the
stream's contact address rather than a form, and where there is no address
either, nothing. A form that can only answer "nowhere to send this" is worse
than the address it replaces.
