"""Resolved push-notification (FCM) configuration with a process-wide cache.

``app.services.platform.push_notifications`` mints an FCM access token from
``_get_fcm_access_token``, which is synchronous and holds no database session —
and the credential it needs is the service-account JSON on
``app_setting_secrets``, which no request-path role may read. So the resolved
configuration is a process-level snapshot here, the same shape
``app.services.storage_config`` and ``app.services.captcha_config`` use.

Push is dispatched from background work as often as from a request, which is
why :func:`ensure_push_config_fresh` opens its own system-engine session rather
than taking one: there is frequently no caller session to borrow.
