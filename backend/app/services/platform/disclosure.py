"""Telling whoever runs this server about a security problem.

Three ways in, one stream:

- **The form**, for a signed-in person who found something: a case in the
  security stream, which they follow under their tickets and talk on with the
  team.
- **"This wasn't me"**, the link in every email about a change to how an
  account signs in (``app.services.auth.security_links``): it ends every
  session and files an ``account_compromise`` case about the account.
- **``/.well-known/security.txt``** (RFC 9116), for somebody outside: the
  security contact, and the form when the stream is bound.

A problem with the *software* rather than this server goes to the project
(``SECURITY.md``); operators forward what they receive with the case's
``tracker_key``.
