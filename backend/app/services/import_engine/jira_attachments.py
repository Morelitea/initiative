"""A Jira issue's attachments, brought over (design §6.1).

An image attached to an issue becomes a blob in the bundle's ``assets/``,
restored by the ordinary backup apply under a storage key made here — so it
is quota-checked, deduplicated and registered like any other upload — and
the markdown shows it where the description or a comment embedded it.

Any other file — a PDF, a spreadsheet — becomes a file document of its own,
attached to the task: a file has one home, the initiative's documents, and
the task is linked to it. Images up to :data:`MAX_IMAGE_BYTES`, other files
up to :data:`MAX_FILE_BYTES`. SVG is left out on purpose: it is markup, and
these are files from somebody else's site.
