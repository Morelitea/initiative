"""An import from an Atlassian site as a job: starting one, and fetching it.

The job's life is the backup's with one step in front of it::

    queued → fetching → staged → (confirm) → queued → running → done | failed

Everything from ``staged`` on is the backup path, unchanged — the fetch writes
the same zip a backup upload stages, and the worker applies it the same way.
What this module adds is the part before that: the request that names what
to bring over, and the worker's fetch that turns it into a bundle.

A queued Atlassian job with no payload has not been fetched yet; one with a
payload has been, and was confirmed. That is the whole of how the worker tells
the two apart (:func:`awaits_fetch`), and it is why a re-claimed fetch drops
its payload on the way back into the queue. The one exception is an uploaded
Confluence HTML export: it is staged under :data:`EXPORT_SUFFIX`, which reads
as not yet fetched, and the fetch converts it rather than calling a site.

**The credential is spent by the fetch.** Everything the apply needs is in the
bundle, so the moment the bundle is staged the token has no further use and is
dropped — the review step can sit for hours without a live secret behind it.
