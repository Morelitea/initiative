"""Talking to an Atlassian site: the one place this app makes that call.

Everything here runs in the **fetch** half of an import, which never opens a
routed content session. It reads a credential on the system engine, speaks to
somebody else's server, and hands back counts and names. The routed,
RLS-enforced session appears only when rows are written, which is a different
module and a later step.

**Egress is bounded the way the app's other outbound calls are.** Every
request goes through :func:`app.services.safe_http.request_public_target`:
https only, the host resolved once to a public address, the connection pinned
to it, and no redirect followed automatically. A site that resolves to a
private address is refused rather than fetched — a LAN-hosted Data Center is
a later, credential-free route (the HTML-export zip), not this one.

**Failures are codes, never prose.** Somebody else's server can say anything,
and an import job records what went wrong for a reader who is not the person
who typed the token. Every failure here becomes one of the
``IMPORT_SOURCE_*`` constants, and the body that caused it is dropped.
