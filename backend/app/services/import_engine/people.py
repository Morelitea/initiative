"""Who each name in a bundle is, in the community it is being imported into.

An envelope names people by **handle** — ``foobar#1234``, the one identifier
that means the same thing in every community — because an id means nothing on
the far side and an address is not a person's identifier here. Matching those
handles to real accounts is the one part of an import nobody can do from the
data alone: two people can carry the same display name, one person can carry
different handles on two servers, and an export from somewhere else carries
names that were never accounts here at all.

So it is asked, not guessed. The plan lists every person the bundle mentions
with a suggestion where an exact handle matched, the importer confirms or
changes each row in the wizard, and the confirmed answer is what this map
holds. A row left unmapped stays unmapped: a name nobody claimed is reported,
never attached to whoever looked closest.

The mapping is re-checked here, at apply time, against real guild membership
on the caller's own routed session — the confirm may have been hours ago, and
somebody named in it may have left since.
