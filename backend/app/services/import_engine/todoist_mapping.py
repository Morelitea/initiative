"""Todoist's CSV export → this app's project envelope.

Pure: it takes the text of an export and returns the document an ordinary
import already applies. Nothing here talks to Todoist, and nothing on the
apply path knows Todoist exists.

**How the file is shaped.** One row per thing, discriminated by ``TYPE``:

``meta``
    The project's own settings (``view_style=board`` and the like). Skipped.
``section``
    A column. Everything after it belongs to it until the next one, so
    sections become the project's statuses and the rows between them are
    placed by position in the file rather than by any field.
``task``
    A task at ``INDENT`` 1. Deeper indents are that task's checklist —
    Todoist nests tasks arbitrarily, this app nests them once, so every
    descendant lands on the nearest top-level task's list.
``note``
    A comment on the row above it. Todoist writes no id anywhere in this
    file, so "the row above" is the only association there is.

**One thing the file cannot give us.** Todoist omits completed tasks from a
CSV export, so an imported project is the work still outstanding. Nothing
here can recover the rest, and the wizard says so before the upload.
