"""The files a zip carries under ``assets/``, put into a community's storage.

A backup and an exported tool's zip both carry files named by the storage key
they had where they were exported, and both restore them here, under that key,
so the references in their envelopes resolve without rewriting.

Every file is what the zip claims only once it has been read. Each is held to
the rule for what it is meant to be — a picture a gallery can show, a file a
document may hold, or either — and stored as the type its bytes turned out to
be. One that is not is left out, and the import says so. A key already stored
here is never written over. The community's storage quota is checked against
the zip's own sizes before anything is written, and those sizes bound what is
read, too.
