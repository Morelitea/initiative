"""Reading a zip an import was handed: opened within its bounds, and each
member read no further than its cap.

Every zip the import engine reads — a backup, an exported tool's zip, a
Confluence HTML export, a bundle a fetch wrote — is opened by
:func:`open_zip` and its members read by :func:`read_member` or
:func:`read_json_member`. Opening checks the central directory: how many
members there are, what they declare they add up to, and that every name is a
relative path. Reading decompresses a member a chunk at a time and stops once
it passes its cap, whatever size the member declared.

A bundle the app wrote itself from a fetch (``fetched``) is held to the
fetch's bounds rather than an upload's, as :mod:`limits` explains.
