"""The one zip an Atlassian fetch writes, whichever products it read.

Jira projects become project envelopes, their sprints calendar envelopes,
their images assets; Confluence spaces become wiki envelopes. All of it goes
into one backup-shaped bundle naming the one initiative the person picked, so
the apply is a single restore — and a link between an issue and a page read in
the same fetch has both of its ends in the same job to be joined.

The zip is written to a temporary file as the fetch goes: each attachment is
added the moment it has downloaded, and the envelopes and manifest once every
product has been read. Only the envelopes are held in memory, because the
passes that join issues, sprints and pages need all of them at once.
