"""An export that travels as a zip: its envelope, and the files it names.

A gallery is its pictures, so a gallery exported on its own downloads as a zip
holding its envelope at the top level and each picture under ``assets/``, named
by the storage key the envelope gives it — the layout a backup uses. Importing
that zip puts the pictures in the community's storage under those keys and then
imports the envelope exactly as a lone JSON file is imported, so every rule the
envelope path has (authorization, the people step, inline or queued) holds.

A wiki's zip carries the uploads filed in it the same way. A zip holding any
other tool's envelope imports too: it simply carries nothing beside it.

Every file is what the zip claims only once it has been read: a picture must
be one a gallery can show, and an upload a file a document may hold. One that
is not is left out and the import says so. A key already stored here is never
written over — a re-import of the same zip reuses the file it already brought
— and the community's storage quota is checked against the zip's own sizes
before anything is written.
