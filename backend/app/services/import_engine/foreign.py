"""Which other products an export can come from, and how to read one.

One entry per product. Each names a pure mapper that turns that product's
export into the envelope an ordinary import already applies, so everything
past this module is the path a project export takes on its way back in — the
same seam ``jira_mapping`` sits on.

The registry is the only place a source is named. An unknown one is refused
here rather than at the route, so every caller gets the same answer.
