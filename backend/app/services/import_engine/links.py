"""The deferred pass that turns what an import *said* into edges.

An envelope names the far end of a link by an **external ref** — a string the
source chose (``"jira:ACME-123"``, ``"task:41"``) — and not by an id, because
at the moment the link is read the far end usually does not exist yet. It can
be later in the same envelope, in a different envelope, or created by a
different importer entirely: a task blocked by another task, a sub-task under
its epic, and a task in its sprint are three rows written by two importers,
and only one of those pairs is ever in the same file.

So nothing resolves as it goes. Every importer does two things and knows
nothing about any other: it **registers** what it created under the ref the
envelope gave it, and it **records** the links it read. Once the last entry
has flushed, the job resolves the whole collection at once — every ref that
found both ends becomes an edge, and every ref that did not is counted.

An envelope imported on its own runs the same code: it resolves the links
whose far end it also carried, and counts the rest. There is no second path.

What this is not: a permission decision. Edges are written on the caller's
routed session, so RLS gates every insert exactly as it gates a link made by
hand. A ref that names something the importer cannot reach resolves to
nothing, which is the same answer as a ref that names nothing at all.
