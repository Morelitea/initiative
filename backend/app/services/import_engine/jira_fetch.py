"""Reading a Jira project into a bundle the ordinary backup importer applies.

This is the orchestration half of the Jira fetch: the calls, the paging, and
the zip. The mapping it feeds is pure and lives in ``jira_mapping``; the
applying is ``backup.apply_backup``, which has existed since long before any
of this and knows nothing about Jira.

**It writes no content row.** The whole fetch produces exactly one artifact —
a zip in guild storage — and touches no table a person could see. That is what
makes it the one phase a crashed job can simply start over: there is nothing
half-applied to duplicate, only a partial payload to throw away (see the
worker's re-claim rule for ``fetching``).

**It never opens a routed session either.** Nothing here needs one: the
credential is read on the system engine and the bundle goes to storage under
an engine-internal key. The routed, RLS-enforced session appears in the apply
phase, unchanged, where rows are actually written.

The bundle is deliberately backup-shaped rather than a format of its own. A
Jira project becomes a manifest naming one initiative — the one the person
picked, carried as ``target_initiative_id`` so the applier files into it
rather than creating something — and one project envelope per project. Every
gate, every count and every report that a restore already has therefore
applies to an import from Jira without being written twice.

    than after the last.

    A project the token cannot read is **counted, not fatal**: somebody who
    ticked four projects and can reach three should get the three and be told
    about the fourth, rather than a failed job and no explanation. Every
    project unreadable is a different matter — that is the selection being
    wrong, and it fails.

    target initiative — its calendars are off, or the importer may not create
    one there. They are still counted, so the plan can say how many are being
    left behind, and no task is linked to a sprint that will not exist.
