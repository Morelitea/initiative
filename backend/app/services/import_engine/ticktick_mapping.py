"""TickTick's CSV backup → this app's project envelope.

Pure, like every mapper here: text in, the document an ordinary import
already applies out.

**How the file is shaped.** A TickTick backup opens with a few lines of its
own metadata and only then the header row, so the header is found by looking
for it rather than by skipping a fixed number of lines — the preamble has
changed length between releases.

One file holds every list in the account. A list is what this app calls a
project, so the import takes one at a time and the wizard asks which. Within
a list, ``Column Name`` is the board column a task sits in, and those become
the project's statuses.

A row with a ``parentId`` is a subtask. This app nests once, so those land on
their parent's checklist rather than becoming tasks — which is also how they
read, since TickTick's own checklist items arrive the same way.
