        The same inventory a backup's manifest carries, taken from one
        envelope: a handle, the name it went by, and how many comments hang
        on getting that one row right. Four kinds of mention put somebody on
        it, because all four go through the answer the wizard records:

        * a comment's author, whose words land under whoever the handle is
          mapped to;
        * an assignee, whose task lands on whoever the handle is mapped to —
          still only if that account is in the target initiative (see
          ``people.initiative_member_id``);
        * a user-type property value — a Reporter, a Reviewer — placed by
          the same rule as an assignee;
        * an ``@`` mention in a description or a comment, which links to
          whoever the handle is mapped to.

        An assignee who wrote nothing is still a question worth asking. Left
        off, a handle nobody here answers to by name was applied without the
        step and reported afterwards as unmatched, with no way to say who it
        was.

        A handle the envelope spelled two ways is one person: it is keyed
        the way it is matched, and the first spelling seen is the one shown.
