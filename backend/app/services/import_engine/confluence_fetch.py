"""Reading Confluence spaces into a bundle the ordinary backup importer applies.

The Confluence half of the Atlassian fetch, and the same shape as the Jira
one: the calls and the paging live here, the mapping is pure and lives in
``confluence_mapping``, and the applying is ``backup.apply_backup``. It writes
no content row and opens no routed session — its one artifact is the zip.

Each space becomes one wiki envelope in a manifest naming the one initiative
the person picked, carried as ``target_initiative_id``.
