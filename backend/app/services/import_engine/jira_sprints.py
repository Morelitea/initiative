"""Jira sprints → calendar events (design D11).

A sprint is a named stretch of time, which is what a calendar event is. So
each one becomes an event, once, on a calendar named after the board it ran
on — and each task that was in it is ``related_to`` it, rather than carrying
the sprint's two dates on forty rows.

Pure, like the rest of the mapping. Sprints arrive inside the issues
themselves — the Sprint field holds the whole sprint, not a reference — so
this reads them out of what the fetch already has. The only thing it cannot
know is what a board is called; the fetch looks that up and passes it in.
