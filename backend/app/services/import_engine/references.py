"""A reference to another thing, carried across an export by the ref it had.

Inside the app a reference names what it points at by id: ``#task[Fix the
bug](41)`` in markdown (a task's description, a comment), and an
``entity-mention``, ``wikilink`` or ``smart-chip`` node in an editor state (a
document, a post, a wiki page). An id means nothing where an export is
restored — on another instance, or in a community where 41 is something else,
and even in the same community a restore makes new rows — so the export writes
each reference as the **ref** of what it named where it was written
(``task:41``), and the restore points it at whatever that ref became:

* markdown: ``#task[Fix the bug](41)`` becomes ``#task[Fix the bug](task:41)``,
  which no reader takes for a reference until the restore puts an id back.
* editor state: the node keeps its text, carries ``importSourceRef`` and holds
  no id (``0``, or ``None`` for a wikilink) until it is placed.

Every row a restore creates registers itself with the job's link collector
under the ref it had (``task:41``, ``document:7``), so once the last entry has
flushed :func:`resolve_references` reads each marked body again and places
every reference: on the row its ref became in this job; on the original, when
the export came from this same community and the thing did not come over with
it; and otherwise on nothing — the reference is its title again, never a link
to whatever holds that id here.
