"""A mention of somebody, carried across an export by handle.

Inside the app a mention names an account by id: ``@[Sam Bee](42)`` in
markdown (a task's description, a comment) and a Lexical ``mention`` node with
``mentionUserId`` in an editor state (a file, a post, a wiki page). An id
means nothing where an export is restored — on another instance, or in a
community where 42 is somebody else — so the export writes each mention as the
person's **handle** and lists it beside the text, and the restore links the
handles the people step placed, the way it already does for a Jira mention:

* markdown: ``@[Sam Bee](42)`` becomes ``@sam#0042`` and the handle joins the
  row's ``mention_handles``; ``project_import._link_mentions`` turns a placed
  one back into ``@[…](<id here>)``.
* editor state: the node keeps its name, loses its ``mentionUserId`` and
  carries ``mentionHandle`` instead; :func:`place_editor_mentions` gives a
  placed one the account and drops the handle. One nobody placed is a name
  with no account, which the editor already draws.

A mention of somebody whose account is gone (anonymized, or no longer
readable) crosses as the name it was written with where it has one, and
nothing else.

A rendered export is read away from the app, so :func:`mention_namer` writes
into it the name each mention reads as now.
