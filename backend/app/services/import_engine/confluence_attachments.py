"""A Confluence page's attachments, brought over (design §6.2).

Two kinds of thing arrive. A picture the page shows becomes an upload,
rendered where the page embedded it — the same path a Jira issue's images
take. Every other file, and any picture the page never showed, becomes a file
document filed in the wiki: a file has one home, the initiative's documents,
and being in the wiki is the relation that is a second view of it (D10).

Both are blobs under the bundle's ``assets/``, restored by the ordinary
backup apply — quota-checked, deduplicated and registered like any upload.
Only what fits: a picture up to :data:`MAX_IMAGE_BYTES`, any other file up to
:data:`MAX_FILE_BYTES`, and the bundle's budget across all of them. What does
not fit, or will not download, is counted rather than guessed at.
