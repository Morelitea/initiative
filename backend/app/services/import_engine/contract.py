"""Import-engine contract: the per-type importer protocol and result shapes.

The engine mirrors the export engine structurally (registry → bound check →
inline-or-job), with one inversion stated once here: **imports are writes,
always** — there is no inline path for read-only actors, and every importer's
``apply`` inserts rows as the importing user.

``apply`` is flush-only: the CALLER owns the transaction (the endpoint
commits an inline apply; the worker commits a job apply; the future backup
orchestrator commits per chunk).
