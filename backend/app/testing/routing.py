"""Routing a test session the way a request is routed.

A test that wants a session inside a community's schema used to write the
routing by hand, naming the role it wanted to be. There is no such parameter
any more: who somebody is in a community is a row, and what that gives them is
computed by the establishment seam. So a test asks the seam, exactly as a
request does — which is also what makes the test's own setup honest, because a
routing now needs a membership or a grant to exist first.
