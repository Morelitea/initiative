"""Test-only: a per-worker pool of built guild schemas, reused between tests.

Building a guild schema is most of what a guild test spends before its own
work starts, and guild ids restart at 1 every test, so without this the same
``guild_1`` is built and dropped again for every test. Instead, a schema whose
test is over is emptied and kept, *parked* as ``test_pool_<id>`` — a name
nothing in ``app/`` enumerates — and renamed back the next time a test
provisions that guild id. Its roles keep their names; nothing uses them while
the schema is parked.

A parked schema has to be exactly what provisioning would build. Two checks
decide whether one still is when its test ends:

* an event trigger records every DDL statement that touches a guild schema or
  ``guild_template`` in ``test_harness.ddl_log``; a schema named there is
  dropped rather than parked;
* a fingerprint of the permissions around the schema — grants on it and on its
  objects, its default privileges, its roles' memberships and attributes, none
  of which reach an event trigger — must equal the one taken when it was built.

``PYTEST_GUILD_POOL=0`` turns the pool off, so every guild is built and
dropped; ``@pytest.mark.fresh_guild_schema`` does the same for one test.
