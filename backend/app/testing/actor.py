"""The one seam for "run this test AS role X": an authenticated test identity
with explicit platform and guild roles, plus optional initiative/project
scaffolding.

The two role dimensions are orthogonal (platform-roles design §7):

* **Platform role** — the tier the public/platform request path assumes
  (``platform_<users.role>``). Defaults to ``owner`` for public-path actors
  (most privileged, so role-agnostic tests run unblocked) and to ``member``
  for guild-path actors — guild access must never depend on platform tier,
  and defaulting low makes the suite prove that continuously.
* **Guild role** — when ``guild_role`` (or ``guild``) is given, the actor gets
  a provisioned guild (or joins the one passed) with that ``GuildRole``;
  requests route through ``/g/{guild_id}`` and assume ``guild_<id>``.

Usage (via the ``acting_user`` fixture):

    a = await acting_user()                                   # platform owner
    a = await acting_user("support")                          # tier ceilings
    a = await acting_user(guild_role=GuildRole.admin,
                          initiative=True, project=True)      # full workspace
    b = await acting_user(guild_role=GuildRole.member, guild=a.guild,
                          initiative=a.initiative, initiative_role="member")
    await client.get(a.g("/projects/"), headers=a.headers)
