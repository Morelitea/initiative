"""How a guild content socket is opened, held and closed.

Every guild socket — the events bus, a tool's change signal, a collaboration
room — enters the same way, here:

1. accept, then wait at most ``AUTH_TIMEOUT_SECONDS`` for the first frame, which
   carries the credential (``MSG_AUTH`` + JSON, or JSON text; a web session may
   send no token and be read from its cookie);
2. authenticate it (``authenticate_ws_token``) on a short-lived session;
3. enter the guild through ``establish_guild_access``, as REST does;
4. ask the channel's authorizer which rooms the socket may be in — the same
   function every re-check calls (:mod:`app.services.content_sockets`);
5. register it, and release the session before the socket's long life begins.

Any refusal closes with ``WS_1008_POLICY_VIOLATION``. What a channel adds sits
in the two hooks: ``prepare`` runs on the admitting session before the socket
is registered, ``joined`` right after.
