"""What this deployment publishes under ``/.well-known``.

``security.txt`` (RFC 9116) says where to report a security problem with this
server: its security contact, and the in-app form where security reports are
taken. It is a 404 where no address is set, rather than naming nobody.

The association files are what a phone reads before an app may run a passkey
ceremony for this deployment.

Both are served only when the deployment's address can carry a passkey at all
(``site_refusal``): a phone would refuse an IP address or plain http anyway.
They are JSON at their exact paths with no redirect, which is what Apple's and
Google's verifiers fetch; every other ``/.well-known`` path answers 404 (the
SPA catch-all reserves the prefix in ``app.main``).
