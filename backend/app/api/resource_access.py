"""Router-level resource authorization — one load-and-check choke point.

`authorize` is the single access decision (feature gate + manage block + DAC);
`load_authorized` and `resource_dependency` add loading on top for fetch-then-act
handlers and FastAPI-injected routes. `RESOURCE_ACCESS` is the enforcement-side
registry: one entry per `Tool`, carrying only how a row is loaded and addressed.
Everything it answers with is derived from the tool itself.

`load_child` does the same for a row inside a tool (`SUB_TOOLS`), which its
tool's sharing reaches.
