"""Installing a plug-in, and what that gives the guild.

Two things carry the weight.

A plug-in mounts an *existing* tool at guild scope — installing the guild calendar
creates an ordinary `calendars` row with no initiative, not a parallel thing. So
the tests assert on the calendar: that it exists, that it belongs to no
initiative, and that a plain member of the guild — who is in no initiative at
all — can actually read it. That last one is the whole point of guild scope, and
it is the assertion that would fail if any layer still assumed a row must name
an initiative.

The other is who may do this. Installing mounts a guild-wide surface, so it is a
guild-admin action; reading the list is not, because the sidebar has to know
what is there.

An embed plug-in is the other shape: it brings no content, so there is nothing to
create, share or trash, and the answer to "who may open this" comes back on the
plug-in itself rather than from grants that do not exist.
