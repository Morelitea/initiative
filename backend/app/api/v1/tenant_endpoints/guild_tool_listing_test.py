"""The guild home's table, asked of every tool it can show.

That table is one table — the tool only supplies the rows — so the six list
endpoints behind it have to answer the same two questions the same way: search
the guild's whole set by name, and order it by name, by initiative, or by when
it was last touched. These tests state that contract once and run it against
each tool, because the failure they exist to catch is one endpoint quietly
drifting out of it.

Search and sort are asserted against the *whole* set rather than the page in
hand: a search that only reached the twenty rows already fetched would pass a
weaker test than the one the guild home needs.
