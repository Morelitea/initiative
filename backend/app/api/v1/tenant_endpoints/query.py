"""Run a reader's own SQL against their guild's data.

Guild-scoped, and gated by nothing more than reaching it: the dependency that
admits the request decides who the reader is, and the query then runs under
exactly the context that dependency established — same identity, same guild,
same grant if there is one. A query therefore returns what its author reaches
through any other part of the app, which is why membership is the whole of the
permission question here.

A statement names datasets rather than a scope, so a caller that belongs to
one initiative sends its id and the rows come back narrowed to it. That only
ever removes rows — the reader still reaches exactly what they reach elsewhere —
and it is what lets an initiative's dashboard ask a guild-scoped question.

What the statement may say, and what running it may cost, are answered in
:mod:`app.services.query`.
