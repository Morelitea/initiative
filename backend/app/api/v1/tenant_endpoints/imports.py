    """Confirm a staged import: flips it to ``queued`` for the worker.

    Optional body ``{"include": {tool: bool}}`` narrows which tools apply
    (backup only; omitted tools default to included), and ``{"people_map":
    {handle: user id}}`` says who each name the archive quotes is here — the
    answers to the wizard's people step. ``{"exclude_properties": [name]}``
    names properties unticked on the review, which are then not created, and
    whose values are left out with them. All are recorded on the job and read
    at apply time; the mapping is re-checked against real membership there,
    because this confirm may be hours old by then.

    Two kinds of job reach this, and they are gated differently because they
    were created differently. A **backup** puts a whole community back, so it
    is the seat only — re-checked here and again at apply time. A lone
    **envelope** is one thing its creator already had the create permission
    for when they dropped it; it is staged only to ask who the handles in it
    are, so that creator is the one who answers, and nobody else confirms on
    their behalf."""
