"""Cross-guild tool lists — the My Tools page.

The page is the guild home's table with the guild boundary taken off: pick a
tool, see everything of that kind that reaches you, across every community you
belong to. Inside each community a My Tools list IS that tool's own list —
its live view, through :func:`tool_lists.list_conditions`, loaded and
serialized by the same registry entry — so what reaches you here is what its
page in that community shows. The made-by-me toggle is the one thing added.

``GET /me/{tool}`` is one route, mounted once for every tool out of
:data:`MY_TOOL_LISTS`. Projects, documents and calendars each had a cross-guild
list of their own before this page existed — for the task wizard, for My
Calendar — and each was its own copy of the same merge. They answer here now,
so the nine lists cannot drift. What survives per tool is what a merge across
communities needs of its own: the order a request that names none falls back
to (one key the rows carry, which every community orders by alike), the page
window and the published description. Everything else is read from
:data:`TOOL_LISTS` — a tool answers in one shape whether it is asked inside a
guild or across them.

Every route keeps the path, method, name and parameters its tool already had,
so the published surface — its operation id included — is unchanged.

All nine run on ``UserSessionDep``: the caller is resolved against the shared
tables as their own platform role, and each guild is then entered with the
membership role they hold there (``cross_guild.gather_across_guilds``), which
is the same ``SET ROLE guild_<id>`` a ``/c/{community_id}`` request makes.
"""
