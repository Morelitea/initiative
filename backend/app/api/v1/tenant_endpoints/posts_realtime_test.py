"""The board's realtime signals — a notice reaches a second window on its own.

End to end, and deliberately so: a real endpoint writes, the capture trigger
logs it, the room sink reads the log, and a socket in that initiative's room
hears about it. Nothing in the endpoints announces anything, so a signal that
is missing, mis-scoped or carrying content fails here rather than in a mock.

Publication is the case worth stating twice: a draft says nothing, and the
moment it goes up — posted outright, or stamped later by the scheduler — is the
moment the room hears about it.
