"""Sharing reaching the audit log.

A share is the last gate in front of a piece of content, and it is rebuilt
from a whole list each time it is saved. What is worth writing down is not the
save — it is each grantee whose level actually moved: granted, raised, lowered
or withdrawn. One record per grantee, and a list saved back unchanged is not
one of them.

Driven through the document grants routes, which are the unified path every
tool's sharing runs through.
