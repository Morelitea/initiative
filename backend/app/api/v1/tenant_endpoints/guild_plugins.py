"""Plug-ins installed into a guild.

Reading is open to every member — the sidebar has to know which plug-ins are there,
and a plug-in's existence is guild-wide knowledge. Installing, renaming, disabling,
upgrading, configuring and removing are guild-admin actions: a plug-in mounts a
guild-wide surface, which is the guild's shape rather than any one member's.

**Who connects follows what the credential is.** Where a vendor authorizes a
person, each member connects their own account, no admin is involved, and
installation never waits for anyone to do so. Where it authorizes an
organization — through a page of its own, which is the only way some vendors
grant one — a guild admin runs that flow once for everybody, exactly as they
would fill in the same connection by hand.

Admins govern the install and its guild-wide credentials either way; they can
see who connected as which vendor account and end that access, but they neither
perform another member's connection nor read its values.

What a member may *do* inside a plug-in is not decided here. The content a plug-in
creates carries its own grants, and the tool that owns it enforces them exactly
as it does for initiative content. A plug-in's *pages* are the
exception, because they have no local content to carry grants: the handoff mint
is where who-may-open-this is settled, against where the seat placed the plug-in
and which roles it allowed there.

Two things a guild admin does not govern. A plug-in the deployment marks mandatory
is installed everywhere and is neither removable nor disableable here — the
operator's registration decides whether it exists. And the operator's kill
switch outranks everything: a service whose registration is switched off reaches
nothing, whether or not the guild wanted it.
