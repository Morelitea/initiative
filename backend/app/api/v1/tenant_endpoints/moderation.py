"""A community's moderation surface.

**Whoever already sees everything in an initiative** reads and settles that
initiative's reports. Not a role name — the standing is
``override_share_restrictions`` ("Full access"), which is what the RLS policy on
these tables keys on too, so the endpoint and the database agree without the
endpoint re-deciding.

Reports are filed as tickets (``POST /me/tickets``, see
``app.api.v1.platform_endpoints.tickets``), the one way any kind of ticket is
filed; where a report goes is decided server-side.
