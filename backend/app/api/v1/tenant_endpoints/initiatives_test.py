    the caller did first — so a second answer matches no row and is refused,
    and nothing is granted behind it. That is what stops an approval creating a
    member that a simultaneous denial then records as refused.

    This drives the two answers sequentially rather than truly concurrently.
    It doesn't need to interleave them: the claim never consults the caller's
    in-memory snapshot, only the row's committed state, so a stale pending
    snapshot and an already-settled row take the same path. Serializing the
    two writers is Postgres's row lock, not this code.
