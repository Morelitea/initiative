"""Guild storage usage for the SPA's usage panel.

The seat's Usage tab shows storage used against the operator-set cap
(``guilds.max_storage_bytes``). The number is the same
``SUM(uploads.size_bytes)`` that ``enforce_storage_quota`` enforces against,
summed over every upload the guild stores; it renders regardless of whether an
external billing URL is configured.

Read on the settings surface, by its admin rung — the same authority as the
caps it is shown against (``GET /communities/{id}``): an administrator, or a
settings grant at either rung, which is how support holding the seat sees the
tab. Not disclosed to regular members, like ``status``.
