"""Trash-can endpoints: list / restore / immediate-purge.

Guild routes operate on the guild in the ``/c/{community_id}`` path; the
cross-guild ``/me/trash`` view (see ``me_trash.py``) spans the user's guilds.
A guild's listing is one statement: a UNION ALL over the trashable models,
each leg selecting only the columns a :class:`TrashItem` carries, ordered and
paged in SQL, with the deleter's name joined onto the page.

Cascade dedup: children whose parent was cascaded-trashed at the same
``deleted_at`` (over the same edges the cascade walks) are filtered out so the trash table doesn't list 200 tasks
under a deleted project — just the project. Restoring the parent
resurfaces the children automatically (see ``soft_delete.py``).
