"""Deleting and duplicating a tool — one route each, mounted once for every tool.

``DELETE /{tool}/{id}`` puts a tool in the trash with everything inside it.
Nine copies of it said the same thing: load and authorize with the delete
action, hand the row to ``soft_delete.trash``, commit. None of that depends on
which tool it is, so the route is mounted per ``Tool`` straight out of the
resource-access registry rather than written nine times over.

What goes in with it is the lifecycle tree's (``services.tenant.lifecycle_tree``),
and restoring or purging it is the trash's (``tenant_endpoints/trash.py``).

Afterwards the tool's room is told it was deleted, so an open window refetches
and finds it gone.

Each route keeps the path, method, status code, tag and name its tool already
had, so the generated client is unchanged.

``POST /{tool}/{id}/duplicate`` copies a tool into an initiative: its own, or
the one the body names. The steps are ``app.api.tool_copy``'s, the same for
every tool, and the answer is the copy as the tool's own read returns it. An
installed app reaches it for each tool that serves apps, under the tool's
write scope, as it reaches the tool's create.
"""

# NOT ``from __future__ import annotations``: the handlers are built per tool
# with ``Annotated[int, Path(alias=cfg.path_param)]`` closing over a local, and
# stringized annotations re-evaluate it where that local is out of scope.
