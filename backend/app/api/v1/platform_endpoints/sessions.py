"""The account's own list of where it is signed in, and the way to end one.

Mounted on ``/auth`` beside the routes that open a session, because this is
the other end of the same thing: sign-in writes a row here, and this is where
somebody reads the rows back and closes one they do not recognise.

**Runs on the system engine** (``SystemSessionDep``), filtered by the
authenticated user. ``auth_sessions`` is reached that way everywhere — the
request path is granted nothing on it — and the filter is what makes this the
account's own list rather than a view of the table. What comes back carries no
refresh-token hash; :class:`~app.services.auth.sessions.LiveSession` selects
the columns a person needs to recognise their own laptop and no others.
