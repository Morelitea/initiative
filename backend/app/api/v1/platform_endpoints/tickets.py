"""Filing a ticket: help, a report, and later the other kinds.

Two routes, both the signed-in person's own:

- ``GET /me/tickets/availability`` — what every stream offers them from where
  they are standing: a form, the stream's contact address, or nothing.
- ``POST /me/tickets`` — the filing itself. The body names its stream, and the
  stream decides what it means.

And the cases they filed, which they follow: the list, one case with what has
been said to them about it, and their answer. What a filer reads is decided by
the operations community's filer role (``app.db.filer_access``), which these
routes read through.
