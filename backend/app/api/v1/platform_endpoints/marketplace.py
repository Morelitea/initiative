"""Maintaining the catalog, and serving the artwork it is drawn with.

Reading the marketplace is not here: what a guild is offered depends on which
apps it has installed, so the shelf and a listing's page are guild-addressed
and live in ``tenant_endpoints/marketplace.py``.

What is here is everything that decides *what this deployment carries*, which
is a property of the deployment rather than of any guild. The owner's routes
are gated on the capability that governs deployment configuration — because
that is what publishing a listing is: the rescan of their own catalog
directory, following the registry (its switch, "refresh now", and uploading a
signed bundle for a deployment that cannot reach it), uploading a listing file,
and reviewing what members share. A member's own routes here are the listings
they shared: reading them, and taking one down. Every write runs on the system
engine; sharing itself starts from inside a community, where the item is read
(``tenant_endpoints/marketplace.py``).

The third route is public: the mirrored artwork a registry's listings are
served from, which is the same bytes for everyone and carries nothing about
any guild.
