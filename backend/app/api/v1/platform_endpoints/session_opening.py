"""Opening the session a sign-in earned, whatever proved it.

Every way in ends the same way — a server-side session, an access token bounded
by it, a refresh token, and one audit record saying which way it was — and
:func:`issue_session` is the one place that writes a session and mints its
token. It stages; :func:`session_store` commits what the caller staged beside
it, or rolls all of it back and answers 503. :func:`mint_for` is the one place
an access token is given its lifetime, so a session narrowed by a community's
compliance setting narrows every token minted for it, on every path.

What each route keeps for itself is the proving. :func:`prove_password` is that
proving for the two routes that take a password, and
:func:`second_factor_outstanding` is what both of them, and the emailed code,
answer with when the account holds a second factor. :func:`prove_second_factor`
takes that factor's answer, at a sign-in and wherever else it is asked for.

:func:`open_session` is a fresh sign-in and :func:`upgrade_session` a step-up
against the session already open. :func:`set_password` is the one write of the
account's password, and opens the session a caller carries on with after it
retires every credential the account held.
