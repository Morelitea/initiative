"""Where a vendor returns a person during an app connection's flow.

Two addresses an operator registers with each vendor client, the same for
every app on this deployment:

* ``GET /app-connections/callback`` — the OAuth redirect: ``state`` and
  ``code`` (or ``error``).
* ``GET /app-connections/setup`` — an installation-style vendor's return from
  its install page: ``state``, ``installation_id`` and ``setup_action``.

What they act on is named by ``state``, which Initiative sealed when the flow
started (:mod:`app.services.tenant.connection_flow_state`). Each also reads the
person from Initiative's own session cookie, checked as every signed-in request
is (an active account, a live session), and goes on only when that person is
the one who started the flow; a community connection also needs them to still
hold its seat. The work runs on the system engine routed into the community the
state names. Each answers with a redirect: onward to the vendor, or to the
landing page with how the flow ended.

Not part of the OpenAPI document: only a vendor sends a browser here.
