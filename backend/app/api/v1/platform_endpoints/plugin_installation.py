"""An installed plug-in's calls about its own installation.

Every route here takes an **installation token** and reaches the install the
token names — no ``community_ref`` in the path, and no scope, because these are
the install's own configuration rather than community content. A token
narrowed to one initiative reaches them too. A member token acts for somebody
and is refused.

* ``GET /installation/config`` — the decrypted configuration: the guild-wide
  values, and each member's managed values. Never a flow's tokens.
* ``GET /installation/connections`` — the plug-in's per-member connections, by
  opaque reference, with status only.
* ``POST /installation/connections/{connection_ref}/token`` — a usable access
  token for one connection, refreshed or minted first.
* ``POST /installation/config-status`` — the plug-in's verdict on the
  configuration it was handed.
* ``POST /installation/events`` — an event the plug-in emits, kept for the outbox
  poller to deliver to the community's subscriptions.
* ``GET`` / ``PUT /installation/metadata`` and ``GET /installation/metadata/lookup``
  — the values the plug-in keeps on items and on its install.

The token is checked by the install seam (``establish_install_access``),
whose standing statement admits the install only while it may act: the
community is in use, the install is on, and its registration is live. The
configuration and event work runs on the system engine, routed into the
community one install at a time (:mod:`app.services.tenant.plugin_channels`).
The metadata routes run as the install itself, on the session the seam routed,
so the table's policies decide which rows it reaches
(:mod:`app.services.tenant.plugin_metadata`).
