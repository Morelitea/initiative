"""Privileged Access Management (PAM) endpoints.

Self-service, time-bound, per-guild access grants: a lower-privilege platform
user requests temporary access to a guild, an approver grants/denies it, and it
auto-expires. See ``app.services.access_grants``.

The reads run on the caller's platform tier (``UserSessionDep``): a grantee
reads their own grants, and an ``access.approve`` holder reads the queue, each
through its own policy on ``access_grants``. Every write — requesting, breaking
glass, deciding, revoking, withdrawing — runs on the system engine, which alone
writes the table; authorization for those is enforced here via capabilities +
ownership, mirroring the ``/operator/*`` endpoints.
