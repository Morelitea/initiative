"""Where an installed app asks a member to let it act as them.

``POST /app-platform/consent-requests`` takes an **installation token** and
names the member by the reference this install holds for them, a ``purpose``
(the app's own id for what it wants to do; absent for app-wide consent), a
``label`` in the app's own words, optionally the initiative the purpose is
bound to, and ``access`` (``read`` or ``read_write``).

The request is routed and stood up by the install seam
(``establish_install_access``), whose standing statement also resolves the
member's reference in the install's own sector, and admits the install only
while it may act. Asking again for the same member and purpose returns the
request as it stands (``200``); a new one is ``201`` and the member is
notified. The member answers on their own consent screen; the app learns the
answer here, or from the token endpoint (``consent_required``).
