"""Telling a change the owner made from a risky one.

A change is the owner's when the session making it was proved with a passkey,
or when it comes from somewhere the account already uses (the phone or desktop
app, or a sign-in at least a day old) and is not one of a run of changes. Any
other change is risky, and the notice reporting it can undo it.

What is read is already on the session row, in the account's own notices and
in its held changes; nothing new is kept to answer it.
