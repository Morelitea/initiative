"""Re-checking the account's password before it changes how it is signed into.

Shared by the routes that add or take away a way in — the second factor, the
passkeys, the password itself — and by the two that end something for good, so
all of them ask the same question in the same words.

An account that holds no password has nothing to re-check, so what stands in
for it is the sign-in itself: :func:`require_password_or_recent_proof` asks
such an account to be on a session opened within the last few minutes.
