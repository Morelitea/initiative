"""Registering, naming and removing the account's passkeys — and signing in.

Mounted under ``/auth`` beside the second factor. Two surfaces in one file
because they are two halves of one thing: the managing routes give an account
something to sign in *with*, and the two ``authenticate`` routes are where it
is presented.

The sign-in pair is unauthenticated and names nobody. The authenticator offers
what it holds for this deployment's domain, the assertion says which credential
answered, and the account is read off that credential — so the challenge the
ceremony begins with belongs to no account at all.

Every route runs on the system engine: ``user_passkeys`` is app_admin-only,
because a credential is presented while signing in, before there is anybody to
scope a policy to.
