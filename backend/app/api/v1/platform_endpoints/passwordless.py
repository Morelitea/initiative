"""An account that signs in without a password.

Mounted under ``/auth`` beside the passkeys that make it possible. Two routes:
giving the password up, for an account that holds another way in, and getting
one back with a recovery code, for an account that holds none.

Every route runs on the system engine for the same reason the second-factor
routes do: the tables they read are app_admin-only.
