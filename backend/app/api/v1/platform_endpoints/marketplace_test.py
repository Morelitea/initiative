Reading the marketplace is guild-addressed and covered by
``tenant_endpoints/marketplace_test.py``: what a guild is offered depends on
which apps it has installed.

What is left here is the operator's rescan of their own catalog directory —
deployment configuration rather than content, so it sits at the top of the
ladder with everything else that decides what this deployment is.
