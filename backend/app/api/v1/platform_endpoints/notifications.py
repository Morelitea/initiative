    notifications from every guild they are in, and some from no guild at all.

    Protocol: the client sends ``MSG_AUTH`` with ``{"token": "..."}`` as its
    first (binary) frame, read by ``app.api.content_socket.read_auth_frame``
    exactly as on the guild sockets; web sessions

    sends back is ``MSG_ACTIVE`` — a sign that its person is at the keyboard,
    which is what keeps them from reading as idle. It names nobody: the socket
    already knows whose it is.

    The stream says "your inbox changed" and never what changed, so the
    decision about content is made by the refetch it provokes: the REST
    endpoints above resolve the inbox from ``current_user`` on a freshly
    validated credential. The socket itself is held to the credential it was
    opened with: it is registered in ``app.services.content_sockets`` as its
    account's socket, re-checked with every other socket, and closed with
    ``WS_CREDENTIAL_ENDED`` once that sign-in ends or the account is no longer
    active.
