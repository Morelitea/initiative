"""Liveness, readiness, and metrics — the routes an orchestrator or a
scraper reaches a pod by.

Two questions, deliberately answered separately.

``/healthz`` asks whether this process is running and its event loop is
answering. It touches nothing outside the process, because a restart is the
only response to a "no" — and restarting a pod whose database went away fixes
nothing while costing its in-flight requests.

``/readyz`` asks whether this pod can serve a request now, which depends on
things outside the process. A "no" takes the pod out of the Service's
endpoints and leaves it running.

Which dependencies get a vote is the whole design. A pod that cannot reach
Postgres can serve nothing, so the three engines decide the verdict. The rest
— object storage, the cross-worker bus, the rate-limit counters — are reported
but do not: each one is normally reachable or unreachable for the entire
fleet at once, and a fleet that removes every pod from rotation over one of
them has turned a partial outage into a total one. They show up in the body as
``degraded`` so an operator reading the probe sees what a dashboard would. A
read replica (``DATABASE_URL_QUERY``) is one of these: losing it costs
dashboards and exports, not every page.

Both probes are unauthenticated, and all three routes are exempt from the
global rate limit: a probe answered with a 429 reports a failure the process
does not have. ``/readyz`` holds its answer for ``READY_CACHE_SECONDS``
instead, so however often it is called, each process checks its dependencies
at most once in that window.

``/metrics`` answers Prometheus's text format for a scrape presenting
``METRICS_TOKEN`` as a bearer token, and ``404`` while no token is set. What it
reports is described in :mod:`app.core.metrics`.

``/page-views`` counts a page the SPA opened, by its route template, for that
scrape to report, and counts nothing while no token is set. It is rate
limited like any other route.
