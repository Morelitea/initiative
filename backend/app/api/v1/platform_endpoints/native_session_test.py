"""The session a native client is given.

The phone and desktop apps sign in like a browser does, and are told apart by
the origin they present. A device's session stands longer unused, and the app
is handed its refresh token in the body as well as the cookie, because it keeps
the token in the platform's secure storage rather than in a jar the browser
manages — so the refresh also has to work without a cookie.
