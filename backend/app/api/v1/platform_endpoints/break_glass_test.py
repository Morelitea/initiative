"""End-to-end tests for the break-glass path (Phase 3).

``data.bypass`` is the right to self-issue a scoped, time-bound, audited PAM
grant. These tests state what that grant is and what it permits:

* an operator/owner issues one in a single step (created and approved), and the
  row records that they were both the requester and the approver;
* a tier without ``data.bypass`` uses the request->approve flow instead;
* reach into a community comes from the grant, so the same request answers
  differently either side of clicking through;
* the pair it issues — a ``read_write`` content grant and a ``superadmin``
  settings grant — permits editing existing content and reading the
  community's configuration, and is short-lived, non-stacking and capped;
* the second factor the platform asks for once any ``data.bypass`` holder has
  one, and the three things that answer it: an authenticator code, a recovery
  code, and an assertion from one of the account's own passkeys.
