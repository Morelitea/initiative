"""What a client is told it may write.

Two answers describe the query surface without reading anybody's rows: the
fields of a dataset, and the words a statement may contain. Both exist so that
a client helping somebody write a query offers exactly what the validator
accepts — so what is worth testing is not the contents of either list but that
neither can drift from the thing it describes.
