    This endpoint registers a new push token or updates an existing one.
    The token will be used to send push notifications to the user's device.

    Which installation the token belongs to is read off the session that made
    the call, not the body: the device's message key store names the same
    sign-in, and matching the two is what lets a message wake the phone that can
    actually read it. A device is sent to while that sign-in stands, and the app
    registers again each time it starts.
    Only a sign-in registers one: a device receives the account's notifications
    from every community, which is more than any key or app is lent.

    A deployment that has switched push notifications off declines (403) and
    stores nothing: there is nothing for the token to be used for, and holding
    it would be keeping an address this deployment has said it does not send to.

    A sign-in holds one registration: a new token replaces the one it held
    before (the device's token rotated, or it moved between Firebase and the
    push relay). That, and the limit per account, keep one account from
    piling up tokens the push relay will answer as dead: enough dead answers
    and the relay suspends this whole server.
