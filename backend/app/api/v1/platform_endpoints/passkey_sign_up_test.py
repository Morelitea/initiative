"""Registering an account whose way in is a key.

An existing account could give its password up once it held a passkey, but a
new one still had to be made with a password — so a deployment that had
withdrawn passwords could take a registration only through an identity
provider. These cover the door that closes that: the gates asked before the
browser is sent to an authenticator, the account that comes out holding no
password, and the recovery set that is its way back to one.
