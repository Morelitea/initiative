"""Signing in with a one-time code sent to an address.

Two routes. :func:`send_sign_in_code` opens a challenge and posts the code;
:func:`verify_sign_in_code` takes the code back and opens the session. Two more
do the same against a session already open — :func:`send_step_up_code` and
:func:`verify_step_up_code` — which is how an account confirms a change to how
it signs in without signing out.

Asking about an address answers the same way whoever holds it — a challenge
is opened either way, and only whether a letter goes out differs. The handle
in that answer is half the proof; the code in the mailbox is the other half,
and neither is a sign-in alone.

Everything runs on the system engine, like the rest of the sign-in routes:
there is nobody to scope a policy to until one of them returns.
