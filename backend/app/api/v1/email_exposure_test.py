"""Which response shapes may carry an address, and which may not.

Two shapes carry a stored address in full: ``UserRead`` on the ``/users/me``
routes, and ``UserEmailRead`` on the routes listing the addresses an account
holds. Both are served only to the address's owner. Every other route that
returns an account returns ``OperatorUserRead``, which masks it, and the shapes
that carry an address field alongside other data — the guild invite, the
access grant — mask it too. A deployment's contact address is not an account's
and is served in full wherever it is shown.

These tests read the OpenAPI schema and hold the app to that split, so a new
route or a new shape has to be a deliberate addition to the lists below rather
than something nobody noticed.
