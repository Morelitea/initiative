    names the role and ``search_path`` the session assumes.

    membership and grant. The rung guard on those routes has already refused
    anyone who does not administer it; what this establishes is the standing
    the database reads.

    ``for_payment`` is the billing handoff, the one way a community held for
    a late payment is paid out of the hold: it admits the seat's own
