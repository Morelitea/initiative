"""Request/response shapes for announcements.

One output shape, :class:`AnnouncementRead`, serves both the notices an
operator wrote and the ones compiled into the app — the client renders them
identically and only ever needs the ``key`` to say "I have read this". The
admin surface adds the fields a reader has no business with (draft state,
audience, authorship) in :class:`AnnouncementAdminRead`.
