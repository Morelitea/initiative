"""Unit tests for the guards on the user schemas.

The old ``avatar_base64`` cap tests are gone with the field: a picture is no
longer carried inside a payload, so there is no oversized-string case left to
bound. What replaces them is the guard on ``avatar_url`` — the read schemas
hand back the path this API serves a picture from, and that value must not come
back in as though it named an image hosted somewhere else.
