"""The shape a tool's history takes when it is drawn as a timeline.

Deliberately not the post schema's. A timeline is a rail of periods with a
count and a place to jump to, and nothing about that is a notice — a queue's
rounds, a calendar's months and a project's activity could each hand back this
same list. What is NOT shared is the query behind it: every tool scopes its own
rows through its own gates, and a generic "give me any tool's dates" endpoint
would be one place to get that wrong for all of them at once.
