"""Initiative/guild backup manifest — the index at the root of a backup zip.

A backup is a zip of per-tool JSON envelopes (each independently versioned by
its own ``type`` + ``schema_version``) plus optional upload blobs under
``assets/``. The manifest is what a future import wizard reads first: it
inventories every entry by type so files dispatch to the right importer, maps
assets back to the documents that reference them, and records what was
deliberately left out (``skipped``) so a backup never silently loses data.

Privacy rule: ``skipped`` lists only items the exporter can SEE but policy
excluded (e.g. file documents when uploads are excluded). Rows invisible to
the exporter under sharing rules are simply absent everywhere.
