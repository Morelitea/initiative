"""Schemas for the question a notice asks.

A poll is offered inline with its post — the board renders the question under
the body, and a card that had to fetch a poll per row would be a board that
fetches five polls per page. So :class:`PollRead` is nested in the post's own
read schema, complete with this reader's ballot, and the only thing that costs
a request of its own is the roster of who chose what.

Two settings decide how much of it a given reader is shown, and they are
different questions:

* ``hide_results`` withholds the **numbers** until the reader has voted or the
  poll has closed, so early answers do not steer later ones. It is served as
  ``results_visible`` rather than inferred client-side, because the reader's
  own ballot is part of the answer and the client should not have to
  re-derive it.
* ``is_anonymous`` withholds the **names** behind the numbers, permanently.
  Counts are shown either way.
