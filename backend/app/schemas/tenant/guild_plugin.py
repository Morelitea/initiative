"""What an installed plug-in looks like over the wire.

One rule shapes every payload here: **a stored secret never appears in a
response.** A connection reports which of its fields hold a value and nothing
about what those values are — to the member who typed them, and to the guild
admin who governs the install alike. Ending access is the useful power; reading
a live credential is not part of it.

The connection blocks are read off the *pinned* definition rather than the
