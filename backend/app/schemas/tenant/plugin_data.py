"""What the widget data plane sends back.

Two payloads, and the difference between them is the point.

:class:`PluginDataResponse` is the plug-in's own answer, read through the returns its
endpoint declares: the ones holding several become rows, the ones holding a
single value stay whole beside them. The projection is by name alone — nothing
here interprets a value, and the manifest is the only thing that says what the
names are.

:class:`PluginWidgetCatalogResponse` is what a dashboard needs before it can bind
anything: which installed plug-ins offer widgets, which sources each widget draws,
and the module the browser will run in its sandbox. It is read off each
install's **pinned** definition, so a canvas is authored against the version the
guild chose rather than whatever the catalog says today.
