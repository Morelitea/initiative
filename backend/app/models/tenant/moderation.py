"""Reports a community's moderators settle.

A moderation report is **not a task**. A task carries a checklist, a priority,
dates, recurrence, a drag position, several assignees with per-assignee
completion, custom properties, tags and a sharing model — a moderator needs
none of it. They look at what was reported and decide. So this is its own small
thing: one row per reported target, holding what it is, why, and what was done.

Platform-handled reports are different work and keep their own shape — they are
intake cases (tasks) in the operations guild, triaged and assigned by staff.
