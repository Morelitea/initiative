    A post has at most one poll — the unique key on ``post_id`` says so — which
    is what lets the whole thing be addressed as ``/posts/{id}/poll`` and lets a
    card render the question under the body without asking which of several it
    means. A notice that needs two questions is two notices.

    A table of its own rather than columns on ``posts`` because a poll is five
    settings and a list of options that most notices do not have, and the board
    reads ``posts`` on every page. It carries no ``initiative_id`` or
    ``guild_id``: it is reached through its post, and that is also how RLS
    resolves it.

    The four switches are the ones a poll actually needs, and each is a
    different question:

    * ``allows_multiple`` — whether a voter picks one answer or several.
    * ``closes_at`` — when voting stops. NULL means it stays open; the value is
      compared to the clock rather than swept, so nothing has to run for a poll
      to close.
    * ``is_anonymous`` — whether the roster names who chose what. Counts are
      shown either way; what this hides is the names behind them.
    * ``hide_results`` — whether the counts themselves wait until the reader
      has voted (or the poll has closed), so early answers do not steer later
      ones.
