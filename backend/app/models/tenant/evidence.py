"""Evidence: what a person attached to a ticket or a report.

A guild-schema table, one row per stored object. A row hangs off exactly one
parent — the community report it came with, or the operations case — and is
reached exactly as that parent is: a report's evidence by those who settle the
report, a case's by those in the case's initiative, and its filer's own by the
filer through their filer role (``app.db.filer_access``).

The object itself is never in ``uploads`` and never served by the upload route.
It is stored encrypted under a key of its own (``app.core.blob_crypto``), and
the row holds that key wrapped for the community the row is in. ``origin_*``
name the object as it was first made, which is what its bytes are bound to: a
copy carried into another community keeps them, and gets a key wrapped there.

How long a row is kept is read from its parent — when the case's task was
done or trashed, when the report was settled — by the retention sweep
(``app.services.platform.evidence.purge_due``), not stored on the row.
