"""Where operations work lands, and which cases are already open.

Two guild-schema tables:

``intake_bindings``
    *This stream lands in that project.* One row per stream per guild, naming
    an initiative, a project, and optionally the status a new case starts in.
    Guild-schema because every id on it — initiative, project, status — is a
    per-schema id and belongs beside the rows it points at.

``intake_cases``
    The key -> task map the writer reads to answer "is this already a case?",
    and the window mark a repeating source is measured against. One row per
    case; ``last_seen_at`` is stamped by the writer, so an unrelated edit to
    the task does not move the window.

Both are initiative-scoped for RLS (see ``app.db.initiative_rls``): a binding
through its project, a case through the task it points at. Reading a case is
therefore exactly as hard as reading the task it describes.
