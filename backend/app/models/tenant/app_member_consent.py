"""One member's answer to an installed app asking to act as them.

An app asks to act as a member for one **purpose**: an opaque id of its own
choosing, such as the automation step that needs a person's name, described by
a ``label`` in the app's own words. A purpose may be bound to one initiative.
With no purpose the request is app-wide: the app acts as the member for
whatever it does.

The row is the request and the member's answer together. It is written when the
app asks (``requested_*``) and answered by the member alone, from a first-party
session (``granted_*``, ``confirmed_factor``):

* **pending**: ``granted_access`` and ``revoked_at`` are both empty;
* **granted**: ``granted_access`` says at which level, never more than was
  asked for;
* **declined**: ``revoked_at`` is set on a request that was never granted;
* **revoked**: ``revoked_at`` is set on one that was.

A member token is issued only while the row is granted and not revoked, and
the install standing reads the row again on every request, so an answer
changes the next request.

The row hangs off ``guild_apps``, so removing the app removes every answer
with it. It is an own-row table: the member reads and answers their own, and
the community's administration reads them and revokes (the ``own_row_*``
policies in ``app.db.tenancy.OWN_ROW_TABLES``).
