    filing, and they live in the body. Both are columns because both are read
    on every draw of the sidebar and rewritten by a drag, which wants to be one
    statement and one transaction.

    Everything else a page connects to is an edge in ``relationships``: a page
    ``part_of`` a task, ``related_to`` another wiki's page, and the
    ``references`` edges read out of the ``[[ ]]`` links in this body whenever
    it is saved. That is the **web**, and it is deliberately not the spine: a
    task can belong to a page without appearing in the page tree.

    its wiki. Titles get rewritten; a link that survives the rewrite is the
