    """One notice on an initiative's bulletin board.

    A post is a whole tool entity rather than a child row, which is what gives
    it the surfaces a notice needs and a child row never has: its own sharing
    (``resource_grants``), its own comment thread with the per-entity switch
    every tool carries, tags, the trash can, and a URL to link at. The board
    itself is the initiative's post list — newest first, with the pinned ones
    lifted above.

    ``name`` is the headline (the shared display column every tool spells the
    same) and ``body`` is a Lexical editor state, the same shape a native
    document stores. That is what buys a post inline images and real smart
    chips — a chip shows a fact ABOUT the thing it names (a task's column, a
    counter's reading) and keeps showing the current one, which the reference
    syntax comment text uses cannot do.

    A board renders bodies, not headlines, so the list endpoint returns them
    and pages small. ``excerpt`` (derived, never stored) is for the surfaces
    that show a post in one line — recents, search, the guild table.

    Pinning is deliberately three columns rather than a boolean. ``pinned_at``
    orders the pinned band among itself, ``pinned_by`` records who lifted it,
    and ``pin_expires_at`` lets a notice about a date stop shouting after it.
    A pin is live while ``pinned_at`` is set and the expiry is unset or still
    in the future — ``pin_is_live`` renders that one rule for SQL, and
    ``is_pinned_now`` answers it in Python for a row already loaded.

    **Publication is two columns: an intention and a fact.** ``scheduled_for``
    is when the author asked for it to go up; ``published_at`` is when it
    actually did. A notice posted now is written with ``published_at`` already
    set and no schedule. A scheduled one is written with neither, and the
    publication sweep stamps ``published_at`` when its time comes.

    Splitting them is what makes every other surface simple. "Is this live?" is
    ``published_at IS NOT NULL`` and nothing has to compare a stored time to
    the clock; the sweep claims a due post by writing a column that was NULL,
    so a claim is atomic and can only happen once; and because the stamp is a
    real write to the row, the search index — which cannot fire on the passage
    of time — is refreshed by the same statement that publishes.
