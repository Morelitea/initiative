"""An app installed into a guild.

Guild-level by definition: an app belongs to the guild rather than to any
initiative, which is the whole reason it exists — some content is guild-wide by
nature (a club's own events calendar), and a tool that lives in one initiative
cannot be that.

The row is *installation state*, not content. It records which listing was
installed, at which version, and how the guild configured it (``config`` /
``secret_fields``). The content itself is an ordinary row in an ordinary table
— a guild-level ``calendars`` row, for instance — owned by the install and
governed by its own grants like anything else. That split is
deliberate: apps mount existing tools at guild scope rather than introducing a
parallel one.

What an install produced is the guild-level content it owns: an owner grant
naming the install (``resource_grants.app_install_id``), which goes when the
install does. There is no list on this row to keep in step with it.

The secret values a guild admin typed into an app's connection form live in
``guild_app_secrets``, encrypted per key, which the seat and the system engine
alone read. This row carries ``secret_fields``, which keys hold a value, so a
read reports only whether a value is present.

Managing apps is the seat's action, which only its role writes; the row is readable by any member of the
guild, because the sidebar has to know an app is there. What a member may do
*inside* an app is decided by that instance's grants, not here.
