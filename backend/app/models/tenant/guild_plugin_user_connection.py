"""One member's own connection to an installed plug-in's vendor.

Some vendors authorize an *organization* and some authorize a *person*. The
first kind is a credential a guild admin types once and the whole guild uses,
which lives in ``guild_plugin_secrets``. This table is the second kind: an OAuth
grant, or anything else where the vendor's answer to "who is this?" is a human
being. Whatever such a credential can reach is what *that person* can reach, so
each member connects their own account and the plug-in holds one credential per
person rather than one for everybody.

Two consequences shape the columns:

* **Installing a plug-in never waits on this.** A plug-in whose only connections are
  per-member is fully installed with no rows here at all; members connect when
  and if they want the features that need it.
* **The plug-in never learns who the member is.** It addresses a connection by
  ``connection_ref`` — an opaque random handle minted per (install, connection,
  member) — so it can select the right credential without holding a user id, an
  email, or a display name, and the same person looks unrelated across plug-ins.

A personal connection is still community-governed access rather than private
property, so the row is readable and removable by its owner **or** by the
community's seat (``app.db.tenancy.MEMBER_CREDENTIAL_TABLES``). What the seat
gets is management — see who connected as which vendor account, disconnect
them, stop them reconnecting. Never the values: they are in
``plugin_connection_secrets``, which only the member and the system engine
reach, and this row carries only which keys hold one (``secret_fields``).

``blocked_at`` leaves the row behind as a tombstone once the values are gone, so
"this person may not reach that system through us" survives without uninstalling
the plug-in for everyone.
