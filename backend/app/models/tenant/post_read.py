    A row exists only once somebody has read the post, so the table is the set
    of (post, reader) pairs rather than a grid of every member against every
    notice — an unread post is the absence of a row, which is also what makes
    "mark unread" a delete rather than a second state to keep consistent.

    The board marks a notice read when it has been on screen, which means this
    is written far more often than it is read and almost always as a batch: the
    endpoint takes a list of ids and upserts them in one statement.

    Reading is not editing, so a row records nothing about the notice itself.
    Deleting the post takes its receipts with it (``ON DELETE CASCADE``), which
    is right: they were facts about a thing that no longer exists.
