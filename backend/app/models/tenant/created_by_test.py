"""Completeness guard for the ``created_by`` column.

Every guild-schema table that models something a person made records its author
under ONE name — ``created_by`` — by subclassing ``CreatedByMixin``. That
uniformity is the point: callers that need a row's author (the trash can,
ownership transfer, account erasure) resolve one column name for every table
instead of a per-table lookup, which is what the old spellings (``author_id``,
``uploader_user_id``, ``uploaded_by_id``, ``installed_by_id``,
``created_by_user_id``) cost.

Coverage is a guild-schema question, so the mixin/exemption checks are scoped
there. **The naming checks are not**: they run over every table in the metadata,
``public`` included. ``guilds`` and ``guild_invites`` carried
``created_by_user_id`` until ``20260820_0189``, and a guard that only looked at
guild tables would not have noticed — nor would it notice the next one.

Pure metadata checks — no database required.
