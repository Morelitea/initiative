"""Guard: the model file layout must agree with the tenancy classification.

Schema-per-guild is a hard DB-layer boundary (per-guild Postgres schemas in
isolated namespaces, no cross-guild context). To keep that boundary legible in
the source tree, every ``table=True`` model lives under exactly one of:

- ``app/models/tenant/``   — tables in ``GUILD_SCOPED_TABLES`` (per-guild schema)
- ``app/models/platform/`` — tables in ``SHARED_TABLES`` (public schema)

This test fails if a model is in the wrong folder, sits unbucketed at the
models root, or maps to a table that ``tenancy.py`` hasn't classified. The single
source of truth stays ``app.db.tenancy`` / ``app.db.initiative_rls`` — this only
asserts the directory mirrors it, so the two can never silently drift.
