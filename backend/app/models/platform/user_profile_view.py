"""The projections of ``public.users`` the request path reads.

``public.users`` itself is not readable on the request path. Two views over it
are, each owned by ``app_profile_reader`` — a NOLOGIN role holding a
column-scoped SELECT on the table — so what is public is decided by the
catalog rather than by whoever writes the next query:

* ``public.user_profiles`` (migration 0214) — the eight columns a profile is,
  read by the cross-guild profile page on a ``platform_base`` session.
* ``public.guild_member_profiles`` — those plus ``display_name``, read by
  every guild-routed session: the name the member set for the guild the
  request is routed into (``guild_memberships.display_name``, migrations 0438
  and 0439), ``NULL`` where they set none, when the handle renders.

Which columns those are lives in ``app.db.user_columns``.

Both tables live in their own ``MetaData``, deliberately: a view is not a
table, and putting one in ``SQLModel.metadata`` would make the table
classification and drift checks treat it as one and try to keep it in step with
a model.

``MemberProfile`` is the mapped class over the guild view. It is what every
tenant relationship that used to point at ``User`` points at now
(``Task.assignees``, ``InitiativeMember.user``, ``Comment.author``, …), so
loading a person from guild content yields a person, not an account. It is
mapped imperatively into SQLModel's own registry so those relationships can
still name it as a string, while its table stays out of ``SQLModel.metadata``.
