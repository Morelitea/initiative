"""The accounts one person has chosen not to hear from.

A row is one account on one account's list. It is private and one-directional,
like ``profile_favorites``: the list is the holder's, and who has ignored *you*
is not a question this table answers for anybody on the request path.

What it governs is arrival, not permission — an ignored account's messages,
requests and mentions do not reach the holder, and the holder's own reach is
untouched. The rule that reads the other direction is
``public.dm_deliverable``, which returns a boolean and never a row.

There is nothing on the row to edit, so no UPDATE policy and no UPDATE grant:
a row is (who, whom, when), and stopping is a delete.
