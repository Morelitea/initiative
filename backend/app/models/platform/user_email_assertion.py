"""Which providers have asserted an address, and when they last did.

An address is one row in ``user_emails``; the providers that assert it are
many. A contractor at two organisations signs into both with one address, and
each organisation's directory asserts it independently — so this is its own
table rather than a column, and neither assertion displaces the other.

An address nobody asserted has no rows here at all: somebody typed it, and the
synthetic ``{subject}@oidc.local`` placeholder minted when a provider supplies
no email claim is invented rather than asserted.

**app_admin-only**, like ``user_emails`` itself.
