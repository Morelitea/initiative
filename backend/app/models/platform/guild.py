    """Lifecycle status of a guild.

    The first four are operator-set from the platform Guilds tab (platform
    `guilds.manage`) and are freely interchangeable:

    - ``active``: normal operation.
    - ``read_only``: members keep read access to content but writes are denied
      at the Postgres role level (routed into ``guild_<id>_ro``).
    - ``suspended``: the guild is in time out. Nobody in it reaches anything
      in it — content or settings, members and admins alike — and only the
      platform lifts it. It vanishes from members' guild lists; its admins
      keep a closed entry, so they can tell a time out from a loss. Set by
      the platform operator alone; the billing service cannot.
    - ``on_hold``: the guild is held for a significantly late payment. Nobody
      in it reaches it, its admins included, and it is absent from every
      member's guild list. Its superadmins are told once, on the way in, whom
      to contact. Set by the billing service, or by the operator.

    Guild admins keep the settings surface (billing / data ownership / danger
    zone) under ``active`` and ``read_only`` only.

    The fifth is not:

    - ``deleted``: the guild has been deleted and is being retained for
      :data:`~app.services.platform.guild_purge.GUILD_RETENTION_DAYS` before
      it is destroyed. Nobody in the guild reaches it, its admins included,
      and it is absent from every member's guild list.

      Reached only through deletion and left only through restore, both of
      which do more than move a column, so it is deliberately not offered in
      the operator's status control and a PATCH that names it is refused.

    PAM/break-glass grants deliberately override all of this: a grantee
    behaves exactly as against an active guild (the resolver's grant branch
    never consults the status), so no status can lock the platform operators
    out — which is what lets an operator look inside a deleted guild before
    deciding whether to bring it back. The status is not serialized to guild
    members.
