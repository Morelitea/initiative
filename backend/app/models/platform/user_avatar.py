"""The picture a user uploaded of themselves.

A name and a face are public information in this product: an avatar is served
to anyone holding its URL, with no membership check, so it lives in ``public``
beside the identity it belongs to rather than in any guild schema. An avatar
crosses guilds by definition — one user is in many — which is also why the
bytes are here and not in the object store: every S3 key is namespaced under a
guild, so there is nowhere else for them to go. ``MarketplaceMedia`` and the
guild banner are here for the same reason.

**Its own table rather than a ``bytea`` column on ``users``.** The ORM names
every mapped column in ``select(User)``, and naming a ``bytea`` column is
exactly what makes Postgres reassemble it out of TOAST — so a column here would
put the whole image on every user load in the app: auth, membership checks,
every join. ``users`` is far too hot for that.

One row per user. Who may write it is decided by the row policies (own-row) and
by ``app.services.platform.user_avatars`` for the moderation path, not here.
