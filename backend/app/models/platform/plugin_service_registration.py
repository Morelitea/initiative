"""Deployment-level registrations for external plug-in services.

A marketplace **listing** says what a plug-in is and what it declares. A
**registration** is this deployment's record that it runs that plug-in. Every plug-in
splits the same way, whatever published its listing:

* **Plug-in facts** come from the plug-in's listing, and only a listing apply writes
  them: ``listing_uid``, ``scope_ceiling``, ``image_digest``,
  ``reference_sectors`` and ``compose``. Every source reads the same
  ``registration`` block (the registry, a local upload, the operator's catalog
  directory, the build).
* **Deployment facts** come from the operator, through ``PLUGIN_SERVICES_CONFIG``
  or the settings form: where the plug-in runs, the public keys its container signs
  with, its vendor values, the switch, the mandatory and operations-only flags
  and the origins.

A registration holds no secret beyond its vendor values. Every call the plug-in
makes to Initiative is a JWT it signs with a key published here (``jwks``, or
``jwks_uri`` on its own origin), and every call Initiative makes to the plug-in is
a JWT under the plug-in platform's own key.

Some columns exist only because of that split:

* ``listing_uid`` — the catalog listing this registration's plug-in facts come
  from. It is what ties the registration to the installs it may reach. Null on
  a registration the operator set up before its listing arrived.
* ``publisher_id`` — the publisher the ``public_id`` prefix names
  (:mod:`app.models.platform.publisher`). Its switch outranks the
  registration's own.
* ``scope_ceiling`` — the most any install of this plug-in may be granted, from
  the plug-in scope vocabulary (``app.core.plugin_scopes``). A community's seat grants
  within it; nothing outside it can be granted. Empty means nothing may be.
* ``mandatory`` — the deployment asserts this plug-in is part of what it *is*, so
  every guild has it and guild admins cannot remove it. The operator's kill
  switch (``enabled``) still outranks it.
* ``operations_only`` — the plug-in is for the deployment's operations community
  (``app_settings.operations_guild_id``) alone: it is offered nowhere else, the
  mandatory sweep installs it nowhere else, and an install anywhere else is not
  live. With no operations community named, it is live nowhere.

* ``vendor_values`` — what the operator supplies for the plug-in's vendor client,
  as the listing's manifest declares it under ``vendor``: one Fernet
  ciphertext per field. ``vendor_ready`` is whether every field the manifest
  requires (``vendor_required``) holds one, computed by the database.

* ``kind`` — ``container`` for a plug-in Initiative calls, ``declarative`` for
  one whose calls Initiative makes itself from its manifest. A declarative
  plug-in's registration has no location and no keys.

**Live** is one rule, stated once in :func:`registration_live_sql`: the
registration is enabled, its publisher is enabled, its required vendor values
are set and, for a container, it has a location and a key set to verify
against; and, asked for one community, the registration is not limited to the
operations community or that community is it.
The install standing, the registration snapshot and every channel that reads
a single row ask it in that form.

**Where its plug-in facts came from** is ``source``: ``registry`` for a listing
the registry signed, ``operator`` for a listing this deployment published
itself, or for a registration whose listing has not arrived yet.

Lives in ``public``: a registration is platform-wide and carries no guild data.
It is written on the system engine by ``plugins.manage`` (owner) endpoints, by
boot reconciliation from ``PLUGIN_SERVICES_CONFIG``, and by listing applies.
