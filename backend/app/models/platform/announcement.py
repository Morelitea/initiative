"""What the deployment has to tell the people using it.

An announcement is a short, illustrated notice shown once and then remembered:
a new feature to look at, a setting that moved, a breaking change to act on.
It is deployment-wide rather than guild content — the same notice reaches every
guild, and it is written by whoever runs the platform — so it lives in
``public`` beside the other operator-owned tables.

Three tables, one idea:

* ``announcements`` — the notices an operator wrote, each an ordered list of
  **sections** (heading, prose, picture). A release note is rarely one
  paragraph; it is "here is the new board view" with a screenshot, then "here
  is where the old filter went" with another, which is why the body is a list
  rather than a single markdown blob.
* ``announcement_reads`` — one row per (person, announcement) recording that
  they saw it and, separately, that they acknowledged it. Keyed by an opaque
  string rather than a foreign key so the *same* table also remembers the
  notices that ship in the app's own source
  (``app.core.builtin_announcements``), which have no row to point at.
* ``announcement_images`` — the pictures those sections show, stored as bytes
  here for the reason guild images are: the public plane has no object store,
  every S3 key being namespaced under a guild, and an announcement crosses
  exactly that boundary.

Who *sees* a given announcement is two independent filters on the row —
a minimum platform rung (``min_platform_role``) and "is a guild admin
somewhere" (``guild_admins_only``) — evaluated in
``app.services.platform.announcements``. They are audience selection, not a
confidentiality boundary: what RLS enforces here is that an unpublished draft
is nobody's business but the author's.
