"""A set of accounts with an open channel, and who is on it.

The conversation row carries an id, a creation time and the roster it was made
with. There is no title, no last-message column and no unread count, because all
three would be facts about content the server does not hold -- and no title
because a thread is the people on it, which is also how it is found again.

**A roster is the identity.** ``roster_key`` is the sorted member ids as text,
written once at creation and never updated, and its unique index is what makes
"one thread per set of people" true rather than merely intended: two people
proposing the same roster at the same moment would both find nothing and both
insert, and a unique index is the same test taken at the moment it matters. It
is composite with ``kind`` so a pair's ``direct`` thread cannot contend for a
key with a group.

Never updated is the load-bearing half. Somebody leaving does not rename the
conversation and does not free the name: the thread is still there, with its
history, for the people still on it.

A membership check cannot be a plain own-row policy, because knowing who the
*other* parties are requires reading rows that are not yours.
``public.dm_in_conversation`` answers that question without handing the rows
over, on the same ``SECURITY DEFINER`` pattern the rest of the DM rules use.
