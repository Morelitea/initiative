    """A community signing its members in through one of the platform's
    providers, optionally narrowed to its own tenant.

    The division of labour: **the operator holds providers, a community
    connects to one.** An operator says this deployment can sign people in
    with Google; a community says its members come in through that, and only
    its own workspace. A community holds no issuer, no client id and no
    secret — so it names no address the deployment will fetch, and there is no
    provider configuration for it to get wrong on behalf of its members.

    A community bringing its own identity provider is the same shape: the
    operator registers it when they onboard them, and the community connects
    to it. Every row in ``auth_providers`` is the operator's.

    A connection says two things at once, because a community says both in
    one breath: which arrivals count as its own (``claim``/``claim_values``),
    and whether they join on arrival (``auto_join``).

    Lives in ``public`` beside the registry it points into. Written on the
    system engine; the request path reads it, scoped by policy to the reader's
    own community, because the guild-access gate consults the narrowing on
    every request rather than trusting an answer worked out at sign-in.
