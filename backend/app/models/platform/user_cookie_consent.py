"""What an account has said may be kept in a browser.

One row per account, holding the current answer rather than a history of
answers: the question is "what applies now", and changing your mind replaces
the old answer rather than qualifying it. (``legal_acceptances`` is the other
shape, and is the other shape on purpose — agreeing to a revision of the terms
is an event that happened, not a setting.)

A browser keeps its own copy, because somebody reading the landing page has no
account yet. This is what carries the answer to the next browser, and what
carries a change of mind back to the first one.
