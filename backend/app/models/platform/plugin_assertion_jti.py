"""The ``jti`` of every client assertion a plug-in has presented.

A plug-in authenticates at the token endpoint with a short-lived JWT it signs
(RFC 7523 §2.2). Each assertion is usable once: its ``jti`` is recorded here
until the assertion's own ``exp``, and a second presentation of the same one
meets the primary key.

Keyed by (registration, jti), so each plug-in has its own namespace, and the row
goes with its registration (``ON DELETE CASCADE``). ``expires_at`` mirrors the
assertion's ``exp``: an assertion past it is refused before this table is
consulted, so the shared jti janitor (:mod:`app.services.platform.jti_purge`)
prunes the row.

Lives in ``public`` beside the registrations it hangs off, and is reached only
by the system engine.
