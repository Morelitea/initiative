"""Ciphertext waiting for one device to collect it.

This is a queue, not an archive. A row is deleted the moment its recipient
acknowledges it, and nothing on the server side ever deletes one on a timer: a
message waits as long as it takes, because a phone in a drawer belongs to
somebody who still expects their messages. What bounds the table is a per-account
byte ceiling enforced at the send path, which refuses a message rather than
accepting one it means to drop later.

There is no sender column. The recipient identifies the sender by which session
decrypts, so nothing would read it — in a two-person conversation the sender is
whoever is not the recipient anyway.

``payload`` is opaque. ``message_type`` is Olm's own framing (pre-key or
normal), which the client needs in order to decide whether to establish a
session or continue one.
