"""State the registry client keeps between refreshes.

Three `public` tables, all operator/system state rather than tenant data:

* :class:`MarketplaceTufMetadata` — the TUF metadata this deployment last
  verified, one row per role (and one per root version). A refresh loads it
  into a scratch directory for the TUF client and writes back what the client
  verified, so every replica starts from the same trusted state and a restart
  does not forget which versions were already seen.
* :class:`MarketplaceRegistryStatus` — one row: which trusted root the stored
  metadata was verified under, and how the last refresh went.
* :class:`MarketplaceMedia` — the artwork a verified listing named, kept
  locally and addressed by its own SHA-256. Listing media is served from this
  deployment, so a stored listing never carries a URL pointing at somebody
  else's host.

None of them names a guild. Like the catalog they describe they are
platform-wide, and their only writer is the system engine.
