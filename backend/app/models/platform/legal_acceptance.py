"""What an account agreed to, and when.

A row is one acceptance of one document by one account: an event, not a state.
Re-consent to a later revision appends another row; nothing here is ever
updated, and nothing is deleted except by the cascade when the account goes.

Written only where the deployment has terms of its own. The documents are
served by the external portal it names; this side keeps the record of what
was accepted, never the text.
