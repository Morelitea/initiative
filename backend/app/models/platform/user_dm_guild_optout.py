"""The communities an account has switched off for direct messages.

A row means **off**. Storing the exceptions rather than a row per (account,
community) is what makes "all on by default" true by construction: a community
joined tomorrow counts with no write, leaving one drops the row through the
foreign key, and the table stays empty for everyone who never touched a toggle.

Only consulted while the account's policy is ``community``. Rows survive the
policy moving away and back, so a week on ``public`` does not cost somebody
their list.
