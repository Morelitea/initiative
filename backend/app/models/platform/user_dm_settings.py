"""How one account answers "who may ask to message me".

One row per account, written when the account is created and seeded from
``AppSetting.default_dm_policy``. Deliberately not a column on ``public.users``:
that table is read whole by the platform tiers, and this is the account
holder's own business (see ``user_ignores`` for the same shape).

An account with no row here reads as ``private`` — the most closed value —
so a creation path that forgets to seed one is closed rather than open.
