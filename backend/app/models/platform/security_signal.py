"""What the security rules have counted, per key and window.

Every instance counts in memory and adds its counts here every few seconds
(``app.services.platform.security_signals``), so a rule sees the whole
deployment's total however many processes serve it, and an attack costs one
write per rule per flush rather than one per attempt.

Keys are kept only as an HMAC of what they counted by — an address, an
account — so this table names nobody. The system engine's alone.
