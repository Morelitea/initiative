"""One installed client of one account, and the keys that identify it.

A device is where a ratchet lives. It is deliberately *not* the same row as an
``auth_session``: a session tracks a sign-in, which rotates and expires, and a
key store has to outlive it — a laptop shut for three months comes back
expecting its history. ``session_id`` names the sign-in it last collected
under, followed across renewals, which is what its push registration names
too.

``identity_key`` and ``fingerprint_key`` are public keys. The private halves
are generated on the client and stay there.

Read by another account only through the directory leg — see the migration —
and only where ``public.dm_apparent_permission`` already says ``open``.
