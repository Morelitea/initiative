"""The images a guild is known by: its icon, and its banner.

Guild identity, not guild content — the same class of thing as the guild's name
and description, and in ``public`` for the same reason those are: a guild that
lists itself in the community directory shows its card to people who are not in
it and hold no role that could read a ``guild_<id>`` schema.

Stored as bytes here rather than in the guild blob store because the public
plane has no object store to put them in: every S3 key is namespaced under a
guild, which is exactly the boundary these have to cross.
(``MarketplaceMedia`` is here for the same reason.) They therefore do not count
against the guild's storage quota.

One row per (guild, variant) — see :class:`GuildImageVariant`. Who may read
which is decided by ``app.services.platform.guild_images``, not here.
