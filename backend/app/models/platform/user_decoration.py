"""What one account may dress its profile in, beyond what ships with the app.

A row is one decoration one person has. It is written when a marketplace pack
is installed and removed when that pack goes; grants are issued rather than
self-served, so the request path holds SELECT on this table and no write verb.

Own-row by policy: a library is the person's, and the only question anyone else
asks about it has already been answered by the profile they are looking at.
