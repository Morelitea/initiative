    """How one provider is arranged for a community that has not said.

    Some deployments are one organisation: one identity provider, one tenant,
    and communities that are its teams. Asking each of two hundred teams to
    repeat the same arrangement makes the operator their queue, which is the
    thing this design is built to avoid. So an operator may answer once, and a
    community inherits the answer until it gives its own.

    **The unit of override is the connection.** A community's own row in
    ``guild_provider_connections`` shadows this one entirely — one row
    shadowing one row, nothing to merge — and that includes a community
    connecting with ``enabled`` off, which is how it declines a default. What
    the community says wins outright, because which provider is theirs and who
    on it counts as theirs is an arrangement, not a floor.

    Deliberately its own table rather than columns on ``auth_providers``. The
    gate reads this on the request path, and the registry is not readable
    there — it holds the operator's configuration, and a default holds none of
    it: a provider id, a claim name, a list of values.
