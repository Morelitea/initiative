"""A reader's standing in one community, computed once per request.

Every initiative-scoped table's policies defer to three functions —
``initiative_access`` (membership), ``initiative_role_permits`` (the reader's
role in the initiative) and ``resource_access`` (sharing) — plus an inline
sub-select for the tool switch. Each of those contains a sub-select, so
Postgres never inlines it: one executor start per call, per row, per nesting
level. Everything they compute except the ``resource_grants`` probe is the
same for every row of a request: who the reader is, which initiatives they are
in, what their role there permits, whether the community's sign-in policy is
satisfied, the admin fact and the grant flags.

Gate 1 already worked the other way: ``SET ROLE guild_<id>`` once per request.
This module is the rest of the reader's standing, written the same way — in
one statement, after the routing, by the database, from its own rows.

**One statement, no binds.** :data:`STANDING_SQL` is a single ``SELECT`` of
``set_config`` calls whose values are sub-selects. It binds no user and no
community: every sub-select reads them back from ``app.current_user_id`` and
``app.current_guild_id``, which the routing statement has just written, so
there is one source and no way to compute a standing that disagrees with the
session it lands on. ``set_config`` returns what it wrote, so the row the
statement returns is what the policies will read, and :class:`GuildContext` is
built from that row rather than from what Python believed.

**Bound to its community.** A standing means nothing outside the community it
was computed in — initiative 5 in ``guild_7`` and initiative 5 in ``guild_9``
are different rows. Two things keep one from answering under another's
routing. The routing statement writes ``''`` into every key here, so between
routing and standing the standing is empty and an empty standing answers no on
every membership leg. And the standing records the community it was computed
for (``app.standing_guild_id``) — a member's routed community, or the one a
grantee's grant names — which every gate that reads it compares against the
routed one.

**Where it lives.** In ``session.info`` as part of the stored routing
parameters, so the ``after_begin`` replay hook re-applies the routing and the
standing together from one entry: a replayed transaction cannot carry the
routing of one community and the standing of another.

#: An installed app's standing, in one statement. Runs as ``guild_<id>_plugin``

#: was issued to, the token's scopes, the narrowed initiative and, for a member
#: token, the member and the purpose are read back from that routing; the one
#: bind, ``:named_refs``, is the references the request names (below).
#:
#: ``install`` is the install when it may act at all: the community's status is
#: one its members use, the install is on, and the operator's registration for
#: its listing is live (on, its publisher on, and holding a key set) and the
#: client the token names. Every value below is computed from it, so an install
#: that may not act has an empty standing. ``live`` says which.
#:
#: An install is a member of the initiatives it is placed in (narrowed to one
#: when the token names it), and its initiative role is exactly what its scopes
#: allow there: a tool's view key for a read scope on it, its create key for a
#: write scope, and every other key denied, so no member default answers for
#: it. It administers nothing, manages nothing, holds no initiative role a
#: share could name, and carries no grant — unless its token carries a
#: standing (``standing_level``), which only an installation token that asked
#: for one does, and only while the seat's grant still holds that scope:
#: ``initiatives:moderate`` on a token narrowed to an initiative makes it a
#: manager there with "Full access", as a moderator is; ``community:admin`` makes
#: it a guild admin, within the one initiative a narrowed token names. Either is still bounded by
#: its resource scopes, which every tool policy asks first. The community's
#: sign-in rules
#: govern people signing in; an install's admission is the seat's consent, so
#: that value is what ``live`` says.
#:
#: A **member token** names a member (``app.current_user_id``) and the purpose
#: they consented to (``app.token_purpose``). ``install`` then also asks that
#: the member still belongs to the community, their account is active, and
#: their consent for this install and purpose is granted and not revoked (and,
#: when it is bound to an initiative, that the token is narrowed to it). What it
#: reaches is the member's own within the install's: the initiatives the member
#: is in and the install is placed in; there, the keys the member's role
#: permits (a manager role, a stored yes, or a default no stored row turns off)
#: that the scopes also allow, and every other key denied; the member's roles
#: and "Full access" within those initiatives; and writes only when the
#: consent is ``read_write``. It is never an admin, the seat, a grantee or a
#: manager. The consent was given from a session that met the community's
#: sign-in rules, so that value too is what ``live`` says.
#:
#: Two more columns carry what the install calls things, both read only in its
#: own sector (``purpose = 'plugin'``, the routed community and the routed
#: install): ``guild_ref``, its live reference for the community, and
#: ``named_refs``, the references in ``:named_refs`` that name somebody there,
#: as ``{ref: [entity_type, entity_id, member]}``, where ``member`` says
#: whether a person is a member of the community — the profiles an install
#: reads are its members' — which is who a mention the request writes may
#: name. A replaced reference still
#: resolves for its grace window, as ``identity_refs.resolve_ref`` has it. The
#: array chooses which rows are looked up; the sector is the routing's.
