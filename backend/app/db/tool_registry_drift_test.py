"""Where a tool registry and the database have to agree.

The registries in ``app.core`` are edited in Python; the shapes they describe
are created by migrations. Nothing in CI notices when one moves and the other
does not, because each is internally consistent — the registry still lists every
tool, and the schema still has every table it was ever told to make.

These assert the join between them, always against the *database* rather than
against another Python list. A test that compared two registries to each other
would pass on exactly the change that breaks a deployment.

Three joins, one per way a tool reaches the schema:

- a tool's own **model**, found by the table name the enum derives;
- the **comment parent column** that model needs on ``comments``;
- the **endpoint kind code** the ``relationships`` node ids are packed from.
