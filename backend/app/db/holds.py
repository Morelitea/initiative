"""Holds, as the database enforces them.

A hold keeps content in place for the platform (``app.services.platform.holds``
places and releases one). While a row's ``held_at`` is set:

- **It reads as absent to the whole community.** One RESTRICTIVE policy per
  holdable table, ``held_restrict``, admits a held row only to the system
  engine and to a request covered by a ``moderate`` content grant
  (``pam_moderate``). It narrows every permissive leg, the community admin's
  included: the one place a community admin does not reach everything in their
  community. Exports, search, ``/me`` views and plug-ins all read through the
  same policies, so none of them has anything to remember.
- **Nobody in the community can change it.** The policy's ``WITH CHECK``
  admits a held row from the system engine alone, so a ``moderate`` grantee
  reads but never writes, and nobody else can set ``held_at``.
- **Nothing deletes it.** ``held_guard`` refuses a DELETE of a held row from
  anyone, cascades included, and an UPDATE from anyone but the system engine.
  Destroying held content means releasing it first, in the same transaction.

``HOLDABLE_TABLES`` is read off ``HoldMixin``, which every reportable kind and
``uploads`` carry, so a new kind is holdable the day it declares the mixin.

``content_holds`` is the platform's record of each hold. It is read by the
system engine and a ``moderate`` grantee, and written by the system engine;
there is no community leg, so a community moderator who places a hold can't
read it back.
