"""The authorization functions the guild policies defer to.

Every initiative-scoped table in every ``guild_<id>`` schema carries policies
that call into one of these. They come in two kinds. The four in
:data:`GUILD_AUTHORIZATION_FUNCTIONS` read only guild tables and are rendered
into each guild schema beside the policies that call them (``guild_ddl``), so
a community's access rules live inside its own boundary and a change rolls
out schema by schema with the provisioning stamp. The eight in
:data:`AUTHORIZATION_FUNCTIONS` read shared tables and live in ``public``,
applied once at boot. Both kinds name the tables they read unqualified, so the
routed ``search_path`` binds ``initiative_members`` to the caller's own schema
(see ``search_path_pinning_test``). Each runs as its caller.

The guild four used to live in ``public`` too, one definition for every
community. The migrations that created them there are frozen, so the copies
they left are retired by :func:`drop_public_copies` on boot, after the guild
back-fill has re-rendered every schema's policies against its local copy:
Postgres refuses the drop while any policy still binds a public one, and the
step reads that refusal as "not yet" and tries again next boot.

**Why they are here and not only in a migration.** They used to exist solely
inside the migrations that created them, carried forward by ``CREATE OR
REPLACE`` and copied again into each downgrade. That left the rules the whole
access model rests on with no file to read, nothing to diff against, and no
repair for a deployment whose migration only half-applied. Every other
DB-enforced rule in this codebase is already rendered from app code and
re-applied on boot — the RLS policies from ``initiative_rls``, the frozen
guards from ``frozen``, the search triggers from ``search_index``,
``search_tsmatch`` from ``bootstrap``. These were the exception.

So: this module is the source, :func:`apply_authorization_functions` runs on
every boot, and ``authorization_test`` fails if the database and this file
disagree. Migrations still create them for the upgrade path, importing from
here rather than holding a copy.

**Editing one.** Change the text here and ship it; boot applies it. A change
that alters *behaviour* still wants a migration, so the deployment converges
before it serves rather than at its next restart. That migration states the
new body in full and keeps the one it replaces for its downgrade: a revision
is a record of one moment, and a body read from this module would change what
a past revision does every time this file is edited. ``CREATE OR REPLACE``
keeps the OID, so every policy deferring to the function picks the new body up
unrewritten.

A guild copy is created with the guild schema first on the ``search_path``,
so the tables its body names are resolved and checked at creation. Resolution
at call time is still the caller's route, which is the same schema.
