"""Every permission key must be reachable by a backfill migration.

A tool that ships adds two ``PermissionKey`` members, and every role created
before that release keeps storing the ones it already had. Nothing is
mis-authorized — an absent row reads as its default — but the stored role no
longer matches the role the code describes.

The guard is the union of the ``_ROLE_PERMISSION_DEFAULTS`` maps across every
migration that declares one: if a new tool's keys are in none of them, the tool
shipped without a backfill and this fails with the missing names.

Each such migration states its own SQL rather than sharing a helper (a helper
holding table names and column names would let a later edit change what a past
revision does), so this loads the migration by path and runs the statement it
actually carries.
