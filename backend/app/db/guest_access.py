"""What a guest's request reaches in a community, held by the database.

A guest is a membership with an end and the ``guest`` rung
(``app.models.platform.guild``). Their request is routed into one of the
community's two guest roles, ``guild_<id>_guest`` or, in a ``read_only``
community, ``guild_<id>_guest_ro``. Three things bound it:

* **Grants.** :data:`GUEST_TABLE_ACCESS` is every table in the community's
  schema the role holds anything on. A table it does not name is refused
  outright, whatever a policy says: the community's settings, its plug-ins, AI,
  imports and exports, join requests, webhooks, moderation and intake. In
  ``public`` the role holds only the ``guest_base`` floor
  (``app.db.public_rls``).
* **The community's own policies,** read off the guest's standing. A guest in
  an initiative reaches what their role there reaches. A guest given items one
  at a time passes the initiative gate in those items' initiatives
  (``guest_item_initiatives``), and sharing decides which rows: every tool
  table and its children ask ``resource_access``.
* **Row narrowing for guests,** in :data:`GUEST_ROWS`: restrictive policies
  ``TO guest_base``, so they never run for anyone else. They keep a guest to
  the initiatives they reach and the sharing rows that name them, on the
  tables no tool's sharing governs.

``guest_base`` reads a guest's own sharing rows outright
(:data:`GUEST_OWN_GRANTS`): the standing statement computes the item
initiatives from them before any standing exists.
