"""The database and ``app.db.authorization`` say the same thing.

These functions used to live only inside the migrations that created them, so
"what is the rule right now" was answered by reading three migrations and a
baseline in the right order. Now the module is the source — boot applies the
six that live in ``public``, provisioning renders the four that live in each
guild schema — which is only true for as long as something checks. This is
that something.

The comparison is on ``pg_get_functiondef`` output, which round-trips: feeding
Postgres its own rendering back produces the identical text, so an exact match
is a fair test rather than a brittle one.
