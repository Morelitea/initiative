"""Apply a guild-scoped schema change to every guild schema, from a migration.

Under schema-per-guild a guild-scoped table (tasks, projects, documents, …)
exists once per guild schema — ``guild_template``, ``guild_1.tasks``,
``guild_2.tasks``, … A normal Alembic migration runs once against ``public``, so
it would change none of them.

The forward pattern has two halves, kept in sync:

1. **Existing guilds (and the template)** — a guild-scoped migration calls
   :func:`apply_to_all_guild_schemas` in its ``upgrade()`` (and the reverse in
   ``downgrade()``); the targets include ``guild_template``. The migration owns
   the DDL (so the migration stays a self-contained, immutable record of *what*
   changed); this helper only owns the stable mechanism of *where* it runs.

2. **New guilds** — provisioning reflects the LIVE ``guild_template`` (see
   ``app.db.guild_ddl`` / ``schema_provisioning.get_provisioning_bundle``), so
   guilds created later include the change by construction — nothing to
   regenerate or commit.

The **drift-guard test** (``schema_provisioning_test``) provisions a fresh
schema and diffs it against ``guild_template`` as a clone-fidelity check.

The legacy ``public`` copies of guild-content tables (pre-squash deployments
still carry them, frozen) are deliberately NOT a target: nothing reads them, and
fresh installs don't have them at all (see the 20260626_0125 baseline).

Example migration::

    from alembic import op
    from app.db.guild_migrations import apply_to_all_guild_schemas

    def upgrade() -> None:
        apply_to_all_guild_schemas(
            op.get_bind(),
            "ALTER TABLE tasks ADD COLUMN archived boolean NOT NULL DEFAULT false",
        )

    def downgrade() -> None:
        apply_to_all_guild_schemas(op.get_bind(), "ALTER TABLE tasks DROP COLUMN archived")

    ``include_public`` is off by default: since the 20260626_0125 squash the
    legacy public copies are frozen (pre-squash deployments) or absent (fresh
    installs), so guild-scoped DDL must not target ``public``.

    Must run inside a transaction (migrations always do): the per-schema
    ``search_path`` is set with ``is_local=true`` so it's scoped to that
    transaction. If a statement fails, the error propagates uncaught and the
    transaction rollback reverts the search_path — there is deliberately no
    ``finally`` reset, which on an aborted transaction would itself raise and
    mask the original error (and could strand a stale search_path on the
    connection). On success we reset to ``public`` for any later statements in
    the same transaction, since Alembic may batch migrations into one.
