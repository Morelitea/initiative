"""What a request-path session may write on ``public.users``.

An account belongs to the person it names. A platform-tier session reads other
people — rosters, pickers and member management all do it — and writes one row,
its own. A guild-routed session reads people through
``public.guild_member_profiles`` and does not reach the table in either
direction. Platform user management (reactivate, platform role, delete, avatar
takedown) runs on the system engine instead, where a capability check is the
authorization.

These run under the real ``app_user`` login with a routed context rather than
the superuser-backed ``session`` fixture: the subject is what a policy does,
and a superuser session would show none of it.
