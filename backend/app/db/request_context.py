"""The shapes a request's database context can take.

A session is routed by handing :func:`app.db.session.set_rls_context` one of
the classes below. The shape is what the session stores and what every
transaction replays, so what Python believes about a session and what the
database is told are the same value.

Each shape names one community at most, by ``guild_id``: the schema and role
the session assumes follow from that and from the kind of access the shape is.
How it reached the community — membership, a content grant, a settings grant —
is the shape itself; which session variable carries the community for the
shared tables' policies is part of what the shape writes.

Every shape answers three things (:meth:`route`): the variables it writes, the
role it assumes and the schemas it resolves in. The variables it does not name
are written empty, which is what keeps one request's context from reaching the
next on a pooled connection.

A shape checks itself when it is built, so a combination that is no request
this system makes cannot be constructed.
