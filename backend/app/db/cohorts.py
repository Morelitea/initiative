"""Communities divided into cohorts, and a request, a system and a query pool
for each.

A database connection keeps the catalog of every table it has opened for as
long as it lives, and each community is a schema of its own, so a connection
that has served every community holds every community's catalog. Dividing the
communities into ``DB_COHORTS`` cohorts, and serving each cohort from pools of
its own, means a connection only ever opens its own cohort's schemas.

:func:`cohort_of` is the one place that says which cohort a community is in.
Everything else asks it.

With one cohort (the default) there is nothing to divide: requests draw from
the one request pool, ``app.db.session.AsyncSessionLocal``, system work from
the one system pool, ``app.db.session.SystemSessionLocal``, and reader-written
SQL from ``app.db.session.query_engine``, as they always have, and nothing in
this module is built.

What a session routes into is noted on the connection it runs on
(:func:`note_route`), so a connection that serves a community outside its
cohort is counted, and in the test suite refused.

Work in a community that follows a write in ``public`` runs after that write
commits, on a session from the community's cohort, registered with
:func:`app.db.post_commit.after_commit`.
