"""A migration must fill a new table before it locks that table down.

``FORCE ROW LEVEL SECURITY`` binds the table's *owner* — which is the
provisioning role every migration runs as. So the moment a revision turns FORCE
on for a table it just created, its own backfill is subject to that table's
policies: the INSERT needs a matching one, and those policies are written for
the request path, keyed on GUCs (``app.current_user_id``,
``app.current_guild_id``) a migration has no value for. There is nothing to
match, and the insert is rejected — as ``guild_images`` and ``user_avatars``
were, on any database that actually had legacy rows to carry over. A fresh
install has none, so the backfill never runs and CI stays green while every
real upgrade fails.

The order is therefore the fix and the invariant: create the table, move the
rows in, *then* enable RLS and grant. Migration 0179 is the reference.

Scoped to tables the same ``upgrade()`` creates. A pre-existing table is
handled the other way round — lift FORCE for the length of the write and
restore it in the same transaction — and that restore is not a lockdown.
