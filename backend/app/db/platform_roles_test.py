"""Phase 1 platform-role ladder: roles exist, are least-privilege, and the
public/platform path assumes the right one.

NOTE on what these can and can't prove: the default ``session`` fixture connects
as the SUPERUSER, which can ``SET ROLE`` into any role and (without an assumed
role) bypasses RLS/GRANTs. So these assert the *catalog* shape (roles exist,
NOLOGIN, no BYPASSRLS) and that ``set_rls_context`` assumes the correct role name
— not that a tier hits a GRANT ceiling (that's Phase 2, and must be tested via the
real ``app_user`` login role, not the superuser session).
