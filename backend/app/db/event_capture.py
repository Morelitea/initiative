"""Change capture — one trigger function, every evented content table.

The capture rule lives in ONE place, ``public.capture_change()``. Per-table
knowledge reaches it as trigger arguments rendered from the registry that already
describes these tables, so installing capture on a new table needs no new
declaration:

* **which initiative a row belongs to** — the ``INITIATIVE_PATHS`` entry that
  renders the table's RLS policies, so an event is scoped exactly like the row it
  describes;
* **which resource the event names** — the table's own primary key, or the parent
  it reports against (below).

What lands in ``event_outbox`` is identifiers, an action, and the **names** of
the columns that changed. Never a value: a consumer reads current state back
through the REST API, where the six gates apply to the read.

Every event names its parents
-----------------------------
A row is rarely interesting on its own: a comment moves a thread AND the count
on the card its parent shows, a task moves its project's board. So an event
also carries the ADDRESSABLE resources between it and its initiative,
innermost first — the chain the registry already walks to stamp
``initiative_id``, stopping at each thing that has a route of its own.

Identifiers, like the rest of the row. A consumer that wants the parent reads
it back through the route that already serves it.

Sub-resources report their parent
---------------------------------
Over half these tables are junctions with a composite primary key
(``task_tags``, ``task_assignees``, ``document_property_values``, …) and no id
of their own. Their first primary-key column is always the FK to the resource
that owns them, so a row appearing in ``task_tags`` is reported as
``tasks.updated`` with ``changed = ['tags']``.

That is also the semantics a subscriber wants: "this task was tagged", not "a
row appeared in a junction table". The owner and the label are both derived —
the owner from the FK, the label by stripping the owner's singular stem from the
junction's name — so a new junction is covered by construction.

The same shape covers sub-resources that DO have an id of their own but are
still a facet of something else (a project's statuses, a document's versions, an
initiative's roles, a resource's sharing). Derivation cannot see that, so those
say it once in ``EVENT_SOURCES`` as a ``ReportsAs``. Either way the resource an
event names is one that already has a detail route, which is what keeps every
id in the outbox resolvable without owing new API surface per table.
