"""Whether this deployment's plans are set by its billing service.

``public.billing_managed()`` answers that inside the database, for the
triggers on ``guilds`` and ``guild_administration`` (migration 0362) that hold
a billing-managed deployment's plan columns and lifecycle statuses to billing.
Its body is a constant rendered here from the environment on every boot, over
the provisioning engine, which owns the function.
