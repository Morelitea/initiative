"""Authoritative table classification for schema-per-guild multi-tenancy.

Single source of truth for *where each table lives* and *how it is access-scoped*
once each guild becomes its own PostgreSQL schema. Two orthogonal levels:

**Level 1 — schema placement:**

- **Shared tables** stay in the ``public`` schema — identity, the tenancy
  roster, platform config, and per-user / cross-guild concerns read *without* a
  guild context (login, "list my guilds", platform staff, SSO auto-join, the
  notification inbox). ``SHARED_TABLES`` is *derived* from
  ``app.db.public_rls.SHARED_TABLE_REGISTRY``, where each one is declared with
  its row security and grants.
- **Guild-scoped tables** move into a per-guild schema (``guild_<id>``) — the
  actual tenant content. ``GUILD_SCOPED_TABLES`` is *derived* as
  ``INITIATIVE_SCOPED_TABLES | GUILD_LEVEL_TABLES`` (level 2), so a guild table
  is declared in exactly one of those — never copied here.

**Level 2 — initiative access boundary (within a guild schema):**

- **Initiative-scoped** tables carry the four ``initiative_member_*`` RLS
  policies deferring to ``initiative_access(...)``. They are declared once
  in ``app.db.initiative_rls.INITIATIVE_PATHS`` (table -> initiative path);
  ``INITIATIVE_SCOPED_TABLES`` is the keys of that registry, and
  the RLS DDL is rendered from it at provisioning time (``app.db.guild_ddl``).
  So adding an initiative-scoped table is a *single* edit (a path in
  ``initiative_rls``).
- **Guild-level** tables (``GUILD_LEVEL_TABLES``) are exempt — guild-wide,
  structural, or own-row — protected only by the schema boundary (the
  ``guild_<id>`` role). Adding one here is the explicit "not initiative-scoped"
  decision.

Every ``table=True`` model MUST land in ``SHARED_TABLES`` or (via level 2)
``GUILD_SCOPED_TABLES``. ``tenancy_test.py`` enforces this against
``SQLModel.metadata`` so a new table can't be added without a placement
decision.
