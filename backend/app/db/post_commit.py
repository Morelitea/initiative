"""Work that runs once a transaction commits, and the tasks this process
starts on its own.

:func:`after_commit` registers a step on a session. The step runs when the
session's outermost transaction commits, and not at all when that transaction,
or the savepoint the step was registered in, rolls back; a savepoint that is
released keeps its steps for the outer commit. :func:`spawn` starts a task that
belongs to no transaction.

Every task either one starts is held here until it finishes, as the event loop
keeps only a weak reference to it. :func:`settle` waits for the steps a
session's commits started, and :func:`settle_all` for every task, as before
the pools close; a task spawned with ``cancel_on_settle`` is cancelled there
instead of waited for.
