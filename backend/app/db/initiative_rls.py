"""Single source of truth for the initiative-member RLS layer.

Each per-guild CONTENT table that is scoped to initiative membership is declared
exactly once here, in ``INITIATIVE_PATHS`` — mapping the table to *how a row
resolves its initiative* for ``public.initiative_access(...)``. From that one
declaration we derive:

- ``INITIATIVE_SCOPED_TABLES`` (``app.db.tenancy`` re-exports it and folds it
  into ``GUILD_SCOPED_TABLES``),
- the rendered RLS DDL (``app.db.guild_ddl`` stamps the
  uniform policy boilerplate around each path), and
- change capture: the table emits events, scoped by that same path and naming
  itself, unless ``EVENT_SOURCES`` (below) says otherwise.

So a new initiative-scoped table is added in ONE place — add a path here — and
the classification, the generated policies, and its event stream all follow.
``tenancy_test.py``, ``guild_rls_test.py`` and ``event_readback_test.py``
enforce that nothing drifts.

This module is intentionally dependency-free (no models, no SQLAlchemy) so it can
be imported by ``tenancy`` and by the build-time generator alike.
