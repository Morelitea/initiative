"""Which guild tables an app can reach, and under which scope.

One registry, ``PLUGIN_TABLE_ACCESS``, table -> :class:`PluginTableAccess`. What an
app's routed role is granted on a table, and the scope that table's policies
ask of an app, are both read from it. A guild table with no entry is out of
every app's reach.

Most of it is derived:

- a table a tool governs (``initiative_rls.governing_path``) takes that tool's
  scope, so ``tasks`` answers to ``projects`` and ``calendar_events`` to
  ``calendars``;
- the surfaces that span tools, and the read-only structure an app needs to
  address an initiative, are named here.

What is left out on purpose is listed in :data:`_NOT_PLUGIN_SURFACE`: rows that
are one person's own state, and machinery a scheduler or an operator runs.
