"""Which guild tables a plug-in can reach, and under which scope.

One registry, ``PLUGIN_TABLE_ACCESS``, table -> :class:`PluginTableAccess`. What an
plug-in's routed role is granted on a table, and the scope that table's policies
ask of a plug-in, are both read from it. A guild table with no entry is out of
every plug-in's reach.

Most of it is derived:

- a table a tool governs (``initiative_rls.governing_path``) takes that tool's
  scope, so ``tasks`` answers to ``projects`` and ``calendar_events`` to
  ``calendars``;
- the surfaces that span tools, and the read-only structure a plug-in needs to
  address an initiative, are named here.

What is left out on purpose is listed in :data:`_NOT_PLUGIN_SURFACE`: rows that
are one person's own state, and machinery a scheduler or an operator runs.
