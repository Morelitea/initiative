"""What a child table's read policy rests on.

A child's read leg is an ``EXISTS`` into its parent, and nothing more: the
inner scan runs the parent's own ``SELECT`` policy, which asks membership and
sharing already, so the child restating them would be the same answer a second
time. That shortcut is only sound while each parent a child walks to carries
**one** permissive ``SELECT`` policy and it is the one the registry renders.

These read the rendered DDL rather than a live catalog, because the render is
what provisioning applies and what a new community gets.
