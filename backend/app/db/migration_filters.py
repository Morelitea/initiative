    """Build the ``include_object`` hook for one autogenerate mode.

    Keeps each mode on its own tables — and, in guild mode, on its own OBJECT
    KINDS.

    Default mode compares shared/public tables only: guild-content tables live
    in the per-guild schemas, so without the filter autogenerate would try to
    CREATE them in ``public`` (the model metadata still declares them for the
    ORM). ``NON_MODEL_SHARED_TABLES`` drops out of both modes — those tables
    carry no SQLModel on purpose (``storage_backfill_state`` is created lazily
    by its service), so every autogenerate run would otherwise want to DROP
    them.

    Guild mode (``-x guild``) inverts the table filter (guild-content tables
    only, compared against ``guild_template``) and additionally scopes WHAT
    autogenerate manages, mirroring the established division of labor:

    * models own **tables + columns** — that's what guild autogen diffs;
    * the artifacts own the dressing — FKs keep their PG-authored names and
      deliberately omit cross-schema references, partial/GIN indexes carry
      opclasses reflection loses (preserving them is WHY provisioning
      reflects pg catalogs — see app.db.guild_ddl), and CHECKs come from
      pg_get_constraintdef — so
      constraint/index objects that exist only on one side are not diffs to
      emit. Metadata-declared indexes/uniques missing from the template are
      still created (a real model change); reflected-only ones are never
      dropped.

    new tool table therefore arrived with
    ``sa.ForeignKeyConstraint(["created_by"], ["users.id"])`` written into its
    migration — a reference from a ``guild_<id>`` schema to ``public``, which
    provisioning omits when it renders the schema (``app.db.guild_ddl``). It
    reached ``guild_template`` and stopped there, which is how twenty-three of
    them accumulated before 20260922_0349 removed them.

    The models keep declaring ``foreign_key="users.id"``: it is what tells the
    app that an integer column names a person, which is how a filter on
    ``created_by`` gets a member picker (``app.services.fields.derive``) and
    how search resolves the resource a row is gated against. This strips it
    only where it would become DDL.
