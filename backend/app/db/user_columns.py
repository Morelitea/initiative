"""Which columns of ``public.users`` leave the account they belong to.

An account row holds two different kinds of thing. A few columns say who a
person is — the handle they are known by, their name, their picture, how the
account stands, what they dressed the profile in. The rest is the account
itself: credentials, addresses, the session counter, every notification
preference, the interface settings, the digest bookkeeping.

The first kind is published; the second belongs to its holder and to the system
engine. This module is where that split is written down, and it is written down
once:

* ``PUBLIC_PROFILE_COLUMNS`` — what a profile is, anywhere in the platform.
  Behind ``public.user_profiles`` (migration 0214), read by the cross-guild
  profile page, and behind ``public.guild_member_profiles``, which adds the
  name a member set in the routed guild from ``guild_memberships`` (0438).

Everything else is ``PRIVATE_COLUMNS``, which is *derived* rather than listed:
a column added to the model tomorrow is private because it is not in that
tuple, and ``user_columns_test`` fails if the tuple ever names a column the model
does not have. The request path holds no privilege on ``public.users``
itself, so a private column is not something a guild-routed query returns null
for — it is something it cannot name at all.

Same registry-vs-rendered split as ``system_grants.py``: this is the current
truth, the migrations remain the record of when it changed, and
``security_invariants_test`` compares both against the live catalog.
