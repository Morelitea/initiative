"""What the guild floor reads of the platform.

``app_guild_base`` is what every routed ``guild_<id>`` role inherits, and
``app_guild_base_ro`` what the read-only and query roles do. Neither holds a
verb on the per-person platform tables: those are read and written under a
platform tier, the bare login role or the system engine. And of the tables
keyed by community, a routed request reads its own community's rows, while
the platform floor keeps reading every community its reader belongs to.

The routed half goes through the seam, as a request does; the platform half
assumes a platform tier the way ``UserSessionDep`` does. Both run on the
superuser setup session, which the ``SET ROLE`` drops to the role under test.
