"""What the person who filed a case may read of it, held by the database.

A filer is not a member of the operations community. They reach the cases they
filed, and within those only their status and the part of the conversation
said to them, through one role that exists in the operations community alone:
``guild_<ops>_filer``. Choosing the operations community creates it; moving or
clearing that choice drops it; boot re-asserts it and removes any copy left in
a community that is no longer the operations one.

Two things bound it, and both are the database's:

* **Grants.** The role holds ``SELECT`` on the columns in
  :data:`FILER_TABLE_ACCESS` and on the columns the community's own row
  policies read while deciding a statement, and on nothing else: not the
  roster, not the initiatives' settings, not a task's title or description,
  not a property. A column it was not granted is refused outright, whatever a
  query asks.
* **Rows.** One permissive policy per granted table, ``TO`` this role alone,
  admits the rows of cases whose ``filer_user_id`` is the routed account: the
  case, its task, the task's status, the stream's binding, and the comments on
  the task said to the filer. Every other policy on those tables answers no
  for a filer, who holds no standing in the community.

The role writes nothing. A filer's reply goes through the filing service, on
the writer's own session, after a read through this role has confirmed the
case is theirs.
