"""Phase 2 platform-role RLS ceilings (migration 0109).

These assert the *DB backstop* added in Phase 2: on the purely-platform tables
(``users``, ``access_grants``, ``app_settings``) a tier physically cannot exceed its
privilege, independent of the app-layer capability checks.

Two complementary styles:

* **Direct ``SET ROLE`` (DB-level).** The ``session`` fixture connects as the
  superuser, but ``SET ROLE platform_<tier>`` drops to a non-superuser role, so RLS
  and table GRANTs ARE enforced from that statement on — exactly like the production
  request path. This proves the policy/grant ceiling without the app layer in the
  way.
* **End-to-end (real-role ``client``).** An authenticated request assumes
  ``platform_<tier>`` on a real ``app_user`` connection, so the moved endpoints
  (operator user reads, owner config writes) run role-scoped, RLS-enforced.
