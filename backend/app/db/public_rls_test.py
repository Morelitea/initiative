Unit half: the registry names every shared table and nothing else, every
policy is well formed, and the render is stable. Integration half: applying
the registry to a migrated database changes nothing — so the migrations and
the registry say the same thing, and a fresh install and an upgraded one
carry the same rules — and the catalog holds no policy the registry does not
name.
