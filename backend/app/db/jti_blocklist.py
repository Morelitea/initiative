"""Shared purge for one-shot ``jti`` replay-guard tables.

Every jti blocklist in the app — the billing service JWT blocklist
(``billing_jti_blocklist``) and the initiative-auto delegation blocklist
(``auto_delegation_jti_blocklist``) — is the same shape: a ``jti`` primary
key plus an ``expires_at`` mirroring the token's own ``exp``. Each row is a
spent one-shot token, and it is **inert once expired** — the token's ``exp``
is checked at verification, before the blocklist is ever consulted, so a
replay of an expired token is refused whether or not its row still exists.
Purging expired rows therefore never re-opens a replay window; it only
bounds table growth.

The shared jti janitor delegates here for every blocklist rather than
re-implementing the DELETE, so the "purge is safe because exp already refuses
replay" invariant lives in one place. Runs on the system engine (``app_admin``
holds DELETE per ``app/db/system_grants.py``); the scoped request roles never
delete.
