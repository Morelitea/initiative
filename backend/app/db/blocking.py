"""What it means for a thing to still be standing in another thing's way.

A ``depends_on`` edge records that one thing waits on another. Whether it is
*still* waiting is a different question, and the answer is a product rule that
differs per kind: a task is done when somebody moved it to a done column, an
event is over when it has happened, a counter is finished when it reaches the
number it was counting to.

This is the one place that answers it. The entries are judgement calls rather
than a law — a kind earns one when there is an honest, cheap reading of
"finished" on the row itself. A kind with no entry reports ``None``, which is
the truthful answer for something that never finishes rather than a ``False``
standing in for one, and nothing counts it as a blocker.

Each rule is a SQL expression over the kind's own table, so the two readers —
the far end of an edge (:mod:`app.db.reference_targets`) and a task's blocker
count (``app.api.v1.tenant_endpoints.tasks``) — work from one definition and
cannot drift.
