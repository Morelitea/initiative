"""CHECK constraints whose values a registry lists, rendered at boot.

A guild model marks such a constraint ``info={FROM_REGISTRY: True}``. Its
values come from the registry its expression reads (the tools, the kinds a
recent view or a relationship may name, the permission keys), so provisioning
renders it into every guild schema rather than a migration freezing a copy: a
value added to the registry is admitted on the next boot, with no migration
restating the list.

Replacing a constraint and validating it are two renders, run in two
transactions. ``ADD … NOT VALID`` checks only new rows and holds its exclusive
lock just until its transaction commits; ``VALIDATE``, run after, checks the
rows already there under a lock that lets reads and writes go on. Both run
only when the replacement's digest moves, so only when a registry changed.
