"""What can be referred to, and how a reference is resolved.

A `#` link, a `[[ ]]` link and a smart chip all name the same thing: one row,
in one guild schema. Resolving one asks two questions — *what is it called now* and
*may this request see it* — and neither answer is written down here.

Both come from :data:`~app.db.search_index.SEARCH_SOURCES`, which every
searchable table already declares:

- ``title`` — the column holding the row's name (``name``, ``title``, ``label``).
- ``dac_tool`` / ``dac_id`` — the resource whose sharing governs the row, which
  is often its parent: a task is shared as part of its project.

So a tool added to that registry becomes referenceable, resolvable and gated
without an edit here. What this module states is only the shape of the
derivation, and the two kinds that are deliberately not referenceable.
