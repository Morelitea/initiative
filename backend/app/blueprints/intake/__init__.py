"""Project blueprints: what "set this up for me" imports for each stream.

Each file here is a :class:`ProjectExportEnvelope` — the same portable shape
the export endpoint produces and ``import_project`` consumes, keyed by name and
handle rather than by id. Setting a stream up is therefore an *import*, and
what it produces is an ordinary project the team restructures however it likes.

A blueprint carries the stream's statuses, the case fields the writer fills
(``app.core.intake.STREAM_FIELDS``), and one seed task explaining how the
project is fed. ``blueprints_test`` holds the files and the registry in step.
