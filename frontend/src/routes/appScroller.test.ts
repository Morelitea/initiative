/**
 * The app shell scrolls; it does not also decide how wide a page is.
 *
 * Those two jobs were one element once, and both symptoms followed from it.
 * A scrollbar renders at the edge of its own scrollport, so a scroller that
 * was also `container mx-auto` put the bar beside the centred column instead
 * of down the side of the app. And `overflow-y: auto` does not stay on one
 * axis — with the other left `visible`, CSS computes that one to `auto` too,
 * which quietly made the shell a horizontal scroller that anything overrunning
 * anywhere could drag sideways.
 *
 * Asserted against the source because jsdom does no layout, which is why
 * neither was visible to the suite.
