/**
 * Where this worker's bundle lands is part of its contract.
 *
 * The ratchet is vodozemac compiled to WebAssembly, and a worker carries the
 * Content-Security-Policy of the response that served its script rather than
 * the document's. The backend attaches a policy that admits WebAssembly by
 * matching the built file's path (`_WASM_WORKER_ASSET_PREFIXES` in
 * `backend/app/main.py`). Vite decides that path from two things — the worker
 * output pattern and this file's name — so both are pinned here, and the
 * backend pins the literal it matches. A rename on either side fails a test
 * rather than quietly serving a policy that refuses to compile the ratchet.
