 * This is the orchestration the page uses: make sure this browser has a device,

 * and collect what has arrived. It is deliberately not React — the ratchet has
 * to advance in a defined order, and a hook re-running is not that.
 *
 * The client is the archive. A collected message is deleted from the server, so
 * what is written to the local log is the only copy this device will have.
