/**
 * "Something here is unread."
 *
 * The same mark at every level of the navigation — community, initiative,
 * tool — so following it inward is one gesture repeated rather than three
 * different signals. Never a number: a count invites you to zero it, and three
 * levels deep it becomes arithmetic nobody asked for when the only question is
 * where to go.
 *
 * The community rail draws its own instead, sized and ringed like a presence
 * badge on the avatar; this is the inline mark for a row of text.
