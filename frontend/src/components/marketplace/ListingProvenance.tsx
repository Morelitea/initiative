/**
 * Who publishes a listing.
 *
 * One name, required of every listing, shown wherever a listing is: the cards,
 * the detail page, and both install dialogs — so the question is answered at
 * the moment of the decision rather than only on the page someone may not have
 * opened.
 *
 * Deliberately not a trust ranking. Every listing on a deployment is there
 * because an administrator put it there — they choose the registry to trust and
 * the files to drop in — so sorting listings by where they came from would
 * imply a distinction the platform does not have. What keeps the name honest is
 * enforcement rather than a badge: `core.*` is reserved to listings shipped in
 * this repository, and a registry's index is signature-checked against a
 * configured key before any listing in it is read.
