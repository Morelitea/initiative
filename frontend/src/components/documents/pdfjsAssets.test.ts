/**
 * Where pdf.js lands, and what it is told to fetch, is part of its contract.
 *
 * pdf.js 6 decodes JBIG2, CCITT fax and JPEG 2000 images in WebAssembly — the
 * formats a scanned or faxed PDF is made of. Two things have to hold for that
 * to work, and neither is visible from the viewer component alone:
 *
 *  - The worker must be served with a policy that admits WebAssembly. A worker
 *    carries the Content-Security-Policy of the response that served its
 *    script, not the document's, and the backend picks those responses out by
 *    path (`_WASM_WORKER_ASSET_PREFIXES` in `backend/app/main.py`). So the
 *    build has to put pdf.js where the backend is looking.
 *  - The worker only loads the WebAssembly modules if `wasmUrl` names a
 *    directory holding them, and the build has to ship that directory.
 *
 * Both sides are literals in `vite.config.ts`, and the backend pins the one it
 * matches. A rename on either side fails a test here rather than quietly
 * serving policy that refuses to compile the decoders, or a viewer that renders
 * scanned pages blank.
