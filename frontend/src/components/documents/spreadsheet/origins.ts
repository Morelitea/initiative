/**
 * Every Yjs transaction origin the spreadsheet writes under, in one place.
 *
 * An origin is how a write says what it was. `Y.UndoManager` tracks a
 * transaction only when its origin is one it was told about, so an origin and
 * its undoability are the same decision — and they are made here, together,
 * rather than in a list kept alongside the call sites.
 *
 * **Nesting.** Yjs flattens nested `transact` calls and keeps only the
 * *outermost* origin. An action that wraps several store mutations in an outer
 * `doc.transact(fn, origin)` is therefore seen as that outer origin alone; the
 * inner ones never surface. Pasting a block is the case to remember: it writes
 * cells, clears a cut's source and replaces formatting through three different
 * stores, and the whole thing reaches the undo stack as {@link PASTE}.
