/**
 * The canvas — many widgets, freely arranged.
 *
 * A 12-column grid where each widget carries its own `{x, y, w, h}`. Layout is
 * part of the definition, so arranging a dashboard is *authoring*: it writes the
 * dashboard's own row and takes DAC write, which is why a viewer without it gets
 * a static grid rather than a disabled-looking one.
 *
 * Below the grid's breakpoint the canvas stacks into a single column, view-only.
 * Drag and resize are desktop authoring affordances; fighting a touch target for
 * them would trade a real interaction for a fiddly one.
