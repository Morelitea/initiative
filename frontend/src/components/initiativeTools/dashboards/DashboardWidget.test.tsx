/**
 * Where a placed widget's data comes from.
 *
 * Two modes, and the difference is a boundary rather than a preference. A
 * widget on a real dashboard resolves its binding through the ordinary
 * RLS-gated hooks, scoped to that dashboard's initiative. A widget in the
 * marketplace preview draws the sample library instead: the listing is not
 * installed, so it has no initiative to read and must be given none — which is
 * what these pin, at the seam where it would regress.
