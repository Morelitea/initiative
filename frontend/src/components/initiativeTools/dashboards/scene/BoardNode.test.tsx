/**
 * A long column overflows rather than squashing.
 *
 * A board column is a flex column that scrolls, and a card hides its own
 * overflow to clip a long title — which makes its automatic minimum size zero.
 * A column of 170 cards therefore shared its height out among them: every card
 * a hairline, its text spilling over the next, and nothing to scroll. What
 * stops that is one class on the card, so that is what this pins.
 *
 * jsdom does no layout, so the height cannot be measured here; the class that
 * decides it can, and a Playwright pass over a real dashboard is what would
 * measure it.
