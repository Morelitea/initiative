/**
 * Who has read a notice.
 *
 * Two lists, and the one that matters is the second: "unread" is the people
 * the notice was *shared with*, which is what makes the number mean anything.
 *
 * The padding case is a layout fact jsdom cannot measure, so it is asserted
 * against the class — which is also the thing that regresses. A worn frame is
 * drawn 128% of the avatar and hangs outside it; a scrolling box clips that,
 * because `overflow-y: auto` computes `overflow-x` to `auto` too.
