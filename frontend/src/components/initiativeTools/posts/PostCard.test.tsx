/**
 * One notice on the board.
 *
 * Three things are load-bearing. A pinned post says so, and says *until when*
 * when the pin has an end — a notice about a date that stops shouting is the
 * whole point of the expiry. The pin control is offered on the reader's
 * authority over the initiative, not on their access to the post: an author
 * with owner-level access to their own notice still cannot lift it above
 * everyone else's, which is the rule the server enforces. And a scheduled
 * notice says it is not up yet, because the card is otherwise indistinguishable
 * from one that is.
