/**
 * Which view of a tool's list is showing — live, templates, or archived.
 *
 * Every tool can be archived, so every tool list needs somewhere for the
 * archived ones to be: a row that vanishes from its list with no way to reach
 * it is a row nobody can take back out. The views are states of one list
 * rather than separate destinations, so this sits beside the list instead of
 * being a second row of tabs, and every view stays visible with its total, so
 * a view advertises itself instead of hiding behind a menu. Which views a tool
 * has comes from the tool registry (`toolViews`).
 *
 * Lives in {@link ToolListToolbar}'s `leading` slot — the scope the list is
 * showing — beside the filter and view controls rather than inside the filter
 * panel, because it changes what the list *is* rather than narrowing it.
 *
 * An export asks a third thing — live and archived both — so it offers "All"
 * as well, and that is the export's default.
