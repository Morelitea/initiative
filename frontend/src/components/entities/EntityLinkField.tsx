 * could only find documents and one that could only find tasks — which between
 * them covered two of the thirteen kinds a link may name. It is controlled: the
 * owning form holds the value and decides when to save, because both of its
 * callers save on submit rather than on each pick, and one of them is editing a
 * thing that does not exist yet.
 *
 * Picking appends. The combobox never holds a value of its own, which is how the
 * one underneath it already behaves.
