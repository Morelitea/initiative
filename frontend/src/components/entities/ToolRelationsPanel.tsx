/**
 * Everything a tool entity is connected to, ready to drop on the page it
 * belongs on.
 *
 * Like the comment thread beside it, this takes the ENTITY rather than a pile
 * of fields pulled out of it: a tool's read schema already carries the two
 * facts a link needs — its id and the initiative it lives in — so a tool page
 * says which tool and which row, and a tenth tool needs no new wiring.
 *
 * `target` splits the thing whose links these are from the tool that answers
 * for them, the same way the comment panel does: an event's links are the
 * event's, while the cache they invalidate is the calendar's.
