/**
 * How much of a tag's name a badge shows.
 *
 * jsdom does no layout, so none of this can assert where the ellipsis lands —
 * that is the browser's job and the point of the change. What it can assert is
 * that the name reaches the DOM whole and the badge carries the CSS that lets
 * the browser cut it, which is exactly what a character cap took away.
