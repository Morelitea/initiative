 * differ only in the chrome around them. The date, what is done with it and
 * what comes back when it is refused live here, so the two cannot drift into
 * disagreeing about any of it.
 *
 * The date is sent and not kept: the server compares it, answers, and writes
 * down only that the question was answered. Nothing here holds it after the
 * request, and the field is cleared on the way out.
