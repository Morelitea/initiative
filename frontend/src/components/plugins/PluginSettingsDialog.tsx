/**
 * One plug-in's settings, opened from wherever the plug-in is.
 *
 * **Every installed plug-in has this**, whether or not it has a page of its own —
 * there is always something a person may want to check or take back. For a plug-in
 * whose whole purpose is a credential it opens where the member clicked rather
 * than sending them to hunt through community settings; for a plug-in with a page it
 * is the gear beside its entry.
 *
 * What shows is scoped to what the viewer actually controls, which is not the
 * same as what they can see:
 *
 * - **Everyone** gets the two answers that are theirs — whether the plug-in may act
 *   as them, and their own half of any connection. Nobody else's appears.
 * - **The seat** additionally gets what the community owns: the community-wide
 *   credential, where the plug-in appears, and the governance view of what every
 *   member has given it.
 *
 * This is deliberately not the community-settings page. That one is about the
 * install — adding, renaming, turning off, removing — and belongs to admins.
 * This one is about a person's own relationship with a plug-in that is already
 * there.
