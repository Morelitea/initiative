/**
 * How many items of a single row fit, given the width the row actually has.
 *
 * Widths are read from the laid-out row and remembered against each item's id,
 * because an item that has been put away measures nothing — and putting items
 * away is the whole point. Keying on id rather than position means a row whose
 * contents swap (an editor toolbar entering a code block, say) measures the
 * new items rather than reusing the old ones' widths.
 *
 * Where there is no layout to read (a row that has not been painted, a test
 * environment), everything stays in the row: showing too much is a far better
 * failure than hiding something with nowhere to reach it.
 *
 * Room for the control that holds the overflow is not reserved here. That
 * control is a sibling of the row rather than one of its children, so it takes
 * its width out of the row's before any of this runs — layout does the
 * reserving, and there is no width left to guess.
