/**
 * A dialog fits the phone it is opened on.
 *
 * Two rules, both of which were broken and both of which are invisible until
 * somebody opens a dialog on a narrow screen:
 *
 * 1. The content box is a grid, so its children are grid items with
 *    `min-width: auto` — a nowrap row or an editor toolbar sets a content
 *    minimum wider than the dialog and spills out of it rather than shrinking.
 * 2. A caller that sets an unprefixed `max-w-*` replaces the base viewport cap
 *    at *every* width, so the dialog loses its margins on mobile. Widths belong
 *    behind `sm:`, where the base `max-w-[calc(100%-2rem)]` still governs
 *    below it.
 *
 * These are asserted against the classes rather than a layout, because jsdom
 * does no layout — which is exactly why neither was caught by the suite.

  // The class-merge rule the case above relies on, enforced across the app: an
  // unprefixed width silently drops the base cap, and every dialog that did
  // that was edge-to-edge on a phone.
  //
  // What counts as an offender is a *fixed* length — `max-w-lg`, `max-w-md`,
  // `max-w-[32rem]`. A width relative to the viewport (`max-w-[90vw]`) or to
  // the containing block (`max-w-full`, `max-w-[95%]`) still fits the screen it
  // opens on, so it is not this bug even unprefixed.
  //
  // `max-w-none` drops the cap outright, which is only safe when the element
  // bounds itself another way — `w-[min(72rem,95vw)]` is already viewport-
  // bounded, so lifting the max is what makes that width apply. Flagged only
  // when nothing else holds it in.
