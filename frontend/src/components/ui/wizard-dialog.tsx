/**
 * The chrome a multi-step dialog shares: the frame, the heading, where you are
 * and the way back.
 *
 * It holds no strings and no opinion about size. Both are deliberate. The
 * dialogs that use this disagree about width and scrolling — a two-question
 * picker and a four-question form are not the same shape — so `className` goes
 * straight through. And the back label stays the caller's, because each of
 * these already has its own key for it and the translations do not all agree;
 * a default here would quietly reword five dialogs.
 *
 * Pair it with {@link useWizard}, which owns which step is showing.
