/**
 * A chip is a word in somebody's sentence.
 *
 * It was set at a fixed `text-xs`, so dropped into a heading it stayed 12px
 * next to 30px text and read as a footnote stuck to the title. Sizing in `em`
 * makes it belong to whatever it sits in — and the padding has to follow, or
 * the box tightens around the text as the text grows.
 *
 * Asserted against the classes, because jsdom does no layout — which is why
 * nothing caught it.
