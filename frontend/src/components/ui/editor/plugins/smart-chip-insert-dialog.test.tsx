/**
 * Inserting a smart chip.
 *
 * Two things that were wrong and are invisible to a type-checker. The dialog is
 * opened from something that hands focus back as it closes, so `autoFocus` on
 * the search box lost the race and the caret landed elsewhere — you had to
 * click the field before you could type. And the suggestion list claimed the
 * full height of a stretched grid item while sitting under that search box, so
 * it hung out of the bottom of the dialog by the height of the box above it.
 *
 * The second is a layout fact, which jsdom cannot measure. What is asserted
 * here is the class that caused it, which is the part that can regress.
