/**
 * The cookie question, put once to somebody arriving.
 *
 * Refusing is a single click sitting beside accepting, at the same size:
 * there is no arrangement of this where agreeing is the quick way out.
 * Everything optional stays off until it is switched on here, so closing the
 * chooser, ignoring it, or never seeing it all land in the same place.
 *
 * What is strictly needed to run the app is stated rather than offered. It has
 * no switch because it has no alternative — the sign-in session, the theme,
 * what you had open — and a switch that cannot move would suggest otherwise.
 *
 * The optional switches are the ones the server says this deployment actually
 * uses. A deployment using none of them — the ordinary case for somebody
 * running this on their own server — is not shown switches for things it does
 * not do, and gets the statement with one way to close it.
 *
 * Off unless the deployment turned it on (``cookie_consent_enabled``), since
 * most deployments are a group's own server reached by people who were sent a
 * link. Mounted once at the root, like the step-up dialogs: a first arrival is
 * as likely to be an invite link or the sign-in page as the landing page.
