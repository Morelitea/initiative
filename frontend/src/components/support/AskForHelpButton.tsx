/**
 * "Ask for help", in the sidebar's bottom row.
 *
 * Here wherever there is somebody to ask: where the deployment takes help
 * requests, the form — about the community the reader is in, where it takes
 * them from there, and always about their own account — and where it takes
 * none but has said who to write to, that address. Where there is neither, it
 * is not drawn — the documentation has a button of its own beside it, so a
 * dead end never stands in for one.
