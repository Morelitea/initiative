/**
 * Create an initiative, one question at a time.
 *
 * This is the first thing most people do in a community — a community now
 * arrives with no initiatives at all — so it is also the first real impression
 * the app makes. The old single form asked everything at once and hid the tools
 * behind an accordion labelled "Advanced", which meant the one decision that
 * actually shapes the place was the one nobody opened.
 *
 * Four questions, in the order somebody actually answers them:
 *
 *   1. What is it called
 *   2. What is it made of          — at least one tool, or there is no place to put anything
 *   3. Who can get in
 *   4. What can they do once in
 *
 * When it is the community's first initiative, step 1 opens by saying what an
 * initiative *is*. Nothing else in the app has had the chance to yet.
 *
 * Step 4 exists because of a gap nothing else closes. The built-in `member`
 * role ships view-only on projects and documents and `create_*` off everywhere,
 * so an initiative created with a calendar has that calendar switched on for
 * its managers and invisible to everybody else. Asking here costs one screen;
 * finding out later costs somebody filing a bug about an empty sidebar.
 *
 * The caller owns the open state — a header button, the `?create=true` deep
 * link, and the redirect after a community is created all drive it — and owns
 * the permission gate. Creating is guild-admin only, which the backend enforces
 * regardless.
