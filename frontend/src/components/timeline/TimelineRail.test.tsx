/**
 * The reusable timeline rail.
 *
 * Written against the generic contract rather than any tool's shape, because
 * that is the thing being kept: a rail that only worked for posts would have to
 * be rewritten for the next tool that wants one.
 *
 * What is load-bearing is that it is a *list of buttons* with dragging layered
 * on top, not a drag surface with buttons bolted beside it — that is what makes
 * it reachable by keyboard and readable by a screen reader, and what makes the
 * same control work on a phone.
