/**
 * A draggable rail of periods, for jumping a long feed to a date.
 *
 * The photo-library pattern: months as ticks down the edge, years labelled,
 * and a bubble that follows a finger or a cursor naming the month under it.
 * One control that behaves the same on a phone and a desktop rather than a
 * hover affordance with a separate mobile substitute.
 *
 * What differs by screen is only how much of it is standing there when nobody
 * is using it. A wide screen has room beside the feed, so the rail sits in it
 * and stays. A phone does not: there the rail is an overlay costing no width,
 * and it comes and goes in three steps —
 *
 * - **idle**: nothing, and nothing to tap by accident either;
 * - **peek**: the feed is moving, so a thumb at the edge says how far down it
 *   the reader is, and fades a moment after they stop;
 * - **open**: the thumb has been grabbed, and the whole rail is there — ticks,
 *   years, and the bubble naming the month under the finger.
 *
 * Each stop is a real `<button>`, so the rail is a list somebody can tab
 * through and a screen reader can read, and the dragging is layered on top of
 * that rather than replacing it. Tabbing into it opens it, which is why the
 * hidden state is drawn with opacity rather than taken out of the page.
 * `touch-action: none` is what stops a drag scrolling the page underneath it.
 *
 * Density is drawn, not counted: a tick's length is its share of the busiest
 * month, which is what makes a year of quiet months and one loud one legible
 * at a glance.
