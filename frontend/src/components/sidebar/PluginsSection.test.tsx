/**
 * Who sees the Plug-ins section, and when.
 *
 * The section shows for everyone, because everyone can do something with it:
 * an admin adds a plug-in, and a member browses the same shelf to see what exists
 * and who to ask for it. What differs is the invitation at the bottom.
 *
 * Disabled plug-ins belong in community settings, not here — the sidebar shows what is
 * on.
 *
 * An admin-only plug-in is hidden from members for the same reason an empty section
 * is: it has no sharing to widen, so the entry would refuse everyone who clicked
 * it. The server says which plug-ins those are; this only honors the answer.
 *
 * And every visible entry leads somewhere: a plug-in with a surface opens it, an
 * plug-in with a credential to supply opens that form, and a plug-in with neither
 * waits under "show more" rather than spending a row on a dead click.
