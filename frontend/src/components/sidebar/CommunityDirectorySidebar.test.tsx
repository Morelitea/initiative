/**
 * The directory's filters, now that they live in the app's sidebar.
 *
 * They sit on the other side of the layout from the cards they narrow, so the
 * address is what carries them across — which makes "did the filter reach the
 * URL" the thing worth asserting here, and leaves "did the grid narrow" to the
 * page's own tests. A shelf also has to carry the search along rather than
 * clearing it: picking a category while searching is a narrowing, not a reset.
