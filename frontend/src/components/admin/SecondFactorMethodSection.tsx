/**
 * Platform → Security: which second factors this server offers.
 *
 * Two things can answer being asked for one, and the server says which
 * (`answers_factor`) rather than this keeping a list.
 *
 * A passkey is both a way in and an answer to being asked for a factor, so it
 * appears here *and* under Ways in — but it is governed in one place only.
 * Its row here reflects that decision and cannot be toggled from this side;
 * two checkboxes writing one bit would let the page contradict itself. The
 * authenticator app is nothing but a second factor, so this is where it is
 * turned on and off.
 *
 * No acknowledgement dialog, unlike the ways in: withdrawing a second factor
 * strands nobody, because it was never anybody's only way to sign in. What it
 * can do is leave a standing requirement with nothing to answer it, and the
 * server refuses that with its own message.
