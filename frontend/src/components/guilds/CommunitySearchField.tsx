/**
 * The community directory's search box, wherever the directory shows one.
 *
 * The sidebar holds it on a wide screen. Below `lg` the sidebar is off-canvas,
 * so the page holds it instead, above the cards it narrows. Both mount this,
 * rather than each keeping a box of its own, so there is one debounce and one
 * place the address is written from and the two can never disagree about what
 * is being searched.
 *
 * The search lives in the URL: this writes it and the page reads it, which is
 * how components on opposite sides of the layout agree without a provider
 * strung between them, and it leaves a filtered directory linkable and
 * reload-proof besides. Typing is debounced before it reaches the URL, and
 * lands with `replace`, so a search is one history entry rather than one per
 * keystroke.
