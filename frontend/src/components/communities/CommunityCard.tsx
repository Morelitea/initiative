/**
 * One community in the community directory.
 *
 * Everything on this card is what the community published by opting in — its
 * banner, name, description, icon, shelves, and how many people are already
 * there. A community the caller is already in keeps its card (so a search still
 * finds it) but offers a way in rather than a way to join twice.
 *
 * The two pictures arrive as URLs and are fetched per card, not carried in the
 * directory payload: a page is up to sixty of these, and each one is then
 * cached against a URL that changes only when the picture does. Every card has
 * a banner: the community's artwork, or the colour it wears instead, which costs
 * no fetch at all.
