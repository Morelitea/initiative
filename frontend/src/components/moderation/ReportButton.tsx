/**
 * "Report this" wherever something can be reported.
 *
 * The flag, the dialog, and the one rule that holds everywhere: you cannot
 * report your own work. Deleting or editing it is already there, and a report
 * about yourself is somebody else's time.
 *
 * Every surface passes what the thing is and which one — nothing else. Where
 * the report goes is the server's decision, so a caller never has to know
 * whether the thing it is drawn on belongs to a community or to nobody.
