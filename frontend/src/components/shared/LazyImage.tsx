 * bytes are not requested until the box is near the viewport, so opening a
 * gallery costs a screen of pictures, not the whole gallery. And it fades:
 * the box is drawn at the picture's shape from the start, in the placeholder
 * colour, and the picture fades in over it once decoded — so the wall keeps
 * its layout while it fills and nothing flashes from blank to loaded.
 *
 * A picture already in the browser's cache fires `onLoad` before the effect
 * that watches for it, so `complete` is checked on mount as well; without
 * that a cached picture would sit at opacity zero forever.
