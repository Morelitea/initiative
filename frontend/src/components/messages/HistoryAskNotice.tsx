/**
 * This device, waiting to be sent the messages it arrived without.
 *
 * The other half of the comparison. The device being asked about shows the
 * code the deciding screen is showing, so whoever is holding both is checking
 * two things against each other rather than being told a number and trusting
 * it. It says nothing about how long that will take, because nothing here
 * knows: the other device has to be opened by a person before it can answer.
 *
 * It can be put away by hand as well as by the day running out. Dismissing it
 * settles nothing: the ask is still outstanding, and history approved on the
 * other device afterwards still arrives — which is what the closing line says,
 * so nobody reads the button as calling the transfer off.
