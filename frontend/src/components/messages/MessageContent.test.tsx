/**
 * What a message body is allowed to become.
 *
 * The formatting is react-markdown's and is not on trial here. What is worth
 * asserting is the narrowing: a direct message renders less than a comment
 * does, and the reasons are about the reader rather than about taste — a
 * picture fetched on arrival reports where they are and when they opened it,
 * and markup carried in the body would be the sender writing their page.
