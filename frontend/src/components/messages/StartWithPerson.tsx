/**
 * Somebody you were sent here to talk to, and cannot yet.
 *
 * My Contacts links every row straight at this page, which means most people it
 * lists arrive with no channel open — a contact is somebody you *share a
 * community with*, not somebody who has agreed to hear from you. So the
 * destination is not an error: it is where the asking happens, and the panel's
 * whole job is to offer the one gesture that leads somewhere.
 *
 * That gesture is only ever about messages. A connection is a different
 * agreement between two accounts, made and unmade on My Contacts, and it does
 * not belong on a page about a conversation — even though accepting one happens
 * to open a channel as well.
 *
 * Which gesture to offer comes from ``dm_permission`` and the pending list,
 * never from a guess about why. The server collapses every refusal into
 * ``denied``, so a panel built from it cannot tell the reasons apart either,
 * and the copy below does not try to.
