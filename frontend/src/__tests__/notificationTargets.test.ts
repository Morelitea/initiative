/**
 * Every destination the server puts on a notification has to be a real page.
 *
 * The server writes a `target_path` into the notification row and the SPA
 * navigates to it. Nothing checks the two agree, which is how the account
 * notices came to point at `/settings/profile` — a path that has never
 * existed. It typechecks on both sides and fails only in somebody's hands.
 *
 * So this reads the paths the backend actually writes and asserts each one is
 * a route this app has. It is deliberately a *frontend* test: the route table
 * is here, and it is the half that changes when a page moves.
