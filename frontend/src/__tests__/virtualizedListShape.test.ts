/**
 * The shape every virtualized list in the app has to keep.
 *
 * Two facts about layout that jsdom cannot measure, and that broke the pages
 * in ways only a person scrolling would notice. Both are asserted against the
 * source, which is also where they regress.
 *
 * 1. **The gap lives inside the measured element.** `measureElement` reads an
 *    item's own box, so a flex `gap` between items is invisible to it: the
 *    virtualizer's model comes out shorter than the real list by the gap on
 *    every row (measured: 32px adrift over three rows at `gap-4`), and
 *    everything below sits in the wrong place.
 * 2. **The list measures where it starts.** Read during render the ref is
 *    still null, and every offset comes out short by the height of the
 *    toolbar and filters above it.
 *
 * The posts board virtualizes in the page; the gallery's grid and timeline do
 * it through a shared row component. Both answer to the same two facts, so
 * they are asked together.
