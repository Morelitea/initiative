/**
 * Every tool list page offers a way in.
 *
 * Import and export are one capability — a tool's JSON envelope round-trips
 * through both — so a tool that can be exported can be imported, and the
 * place a file gets dropped is the list page for the thing inside it. The
 * failure this guards is quiet: the endpoint works, the importer works, and
 * there is simply nowhere in the app to hand it a file. Wikis, galleries and
 * posts all shipped importers that way, and posts stayed unreachable longest
 * because it is the one board that does not go through {@link ToolIndexPage}.
 *
 * Asserted against the source, because the alternative is mounting four
 * pages' worth of providers to look for one menu item — and the thing that
 * actually regresses is a page being written without the wiring.
 *
 * {@link ToolIndexPage} covers every tool with no list page of its own
 * (wikis, galleries, queues, counter groups, …), so it is on the list too:
 * the entry disappearing from it would take all of them at once.
