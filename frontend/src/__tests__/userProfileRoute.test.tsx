/**
 * The way to a person's profile, through the router the app ships.
 *
 * A profile is only useful if it is reachable: the generated route tree has to
 * serve `/u/{userId}` — outside the community tree, because a profile is public
 * and belongs to no community — and load the page from its own chunk. A test
 * that mounts the page component directly proves neither, so this one goes
 * through the tree and preloads the route's own component.
