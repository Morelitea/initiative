/**
 * The board's filters, and its scrolling.
 *
 * The feed and the timeline rail beside it are asked the same question: the
 * rail is the map of the feed, so a map of other notices would mislead.
 *
 * Scrolling is a fact about layout that jsdom cannot measure, and that broke the page in a
 * way only a person scrolling would notice. It is asserted against the source,
 * which is also where it regresses.
 *
 * **Virtualization is not conditional.** Turning it on partway down swaps
 * every rendered card for an estimated one while the reader is mid-scroll; the
 * browser holds the offset as the content changes height under it, and the
 * reader ends up somewhere else — in practice, back at the top.
 *
 * How the list measures itself is a shape every virtualized list in the app
 * keeps, proved once in `src/__tests__/virtualizedListShape.test.ts`.
