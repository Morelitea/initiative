/**
 * The wall's scrolling.
 *
 * Facts about layout that jsdom cannot measure and that a person scrolling
 * would notice, asserted against the source the way the board's are.
 *
 * 1. **The list is fetched as it is read.** An infinite query with a
 *    sentinel at the bottom, not a page in the URL: a wall is scrolled.
 * 2. **Every view is virtualized from the first render.** The grid and the
 *    timeline through the shared row virtualizer, the masonry through a
 *    window over placements it computes without measuring — none of them
 *    mounts the whole gallery.
 *
 * How the shared row virtualizer measures itself is a shape every virtualized
 * list in the app keeps, proved once in
 * `src/__tests__/virtualizedListShape.test.ts`.
