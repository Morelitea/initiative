/**
 * My Messages — the conversations this account has open, read on this device.
 *
 * Two things about this page are unlike every other list in the product:
 *
 * * **The thread comes out of local storage, not an endpoint.** The server
 *   deletes a message once this device has collected it, so what is on screen
 *   is what this device decrypted and wrote down.
 * * **A device that has never been here has no history.** That is what forward
 *   secrecy costs, and the page says so rather than looking broken.
 *
 * It is also the page a contacts row points at, via `?with=<handle>`. Most of
 * the people it can be opened for have no channel yet — a contact is somebody
 * you share a community with, not somebody who agreed to hear from you — so the
 * handle is a request to open a conversation, and what comes back may be the
 * offer to ask for one instead.

                          width is a poor guess at what a device can do -- so
                          the tap is simply always there, and on a pointer it

                          It carries no role and takes no focus on purpose: a
                          button role would wrap the links inside it in a

                          one opens the bar through `focus-within`. So the two
