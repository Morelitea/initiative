/**
 * Reading a listing, and getting back out.
 *
 * The shelf you were browsing has to survive the round trip. Both ways out of
 * this page lead to the marketplace, and each one has to carry the kind —
 * otherwise an admin browsing plug-ins clicks a listing, comes back, and is looking
 * at dashboards. The error route is the one that got missed first, which is why
 * it is pinned here alongside the ordinary one.
 *
 * Everyone reads the same page. What changes is the ending: only the
 * superadmin adds a plug-in, so anyone else is told who can instead of being
 * offered a button that would be refused.
 *
 * A project listing is drawn from the listing alone, and installing it is a
 * copy into an initiative the viewer may create projects in.
