/**
 * What a refetch is allowed to do to a form somebody is typing in.
 *
 * These settings fill themselves in from the entity the frame loaded, and used
 * to refill whenever a fresh copy of it arrived. That happens for reasons that
 * have nothing to do with the reader — a realtime signal about the thing being
 * edited, a window brought back to the front, another query's mutation — so it
 * landed on half-written text and replaced it. Handing the section a changed
 * entity is exactly what those refetches do.
