/**
 * The community directory, as a place you browse.
 *
 * The cards, and only the cards. What narrows them — the search box and the
 * shelves a community can file itself under — is the app's sidebar while this page
 * is open (``CommunityDirectorySidebar``), which is where every other place in
 * the app keeps what it is browsed by. The two agree through the URL: the
 * sidebar writes ``q`` and ``category``, this reads them, and a filtered
 * directory is therefore a link.
 *
 * The directory is platform-level, so this asks nothing about the caller's
 * current community. Whether they are already in one of these is answered by the
 * card payload itself.
 *
 * Whether there is a directory at all is the platform owner's setting. Where it
 * is off the page still exists — it can be linked to, and a link should say
 * what happened — but it says so instead of searching. A client that had not
 * heard yet asks and is refused, which lands in the same place: the server's
 * answer is what settles it, not the config this page loaded with.
