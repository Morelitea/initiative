 * worse than a queue of dialogs shown in turn. Being *shown* one is recorded
 * separately from acknowledging it, so a notice that was seen but left open
 * still comes back, while one that was dismissed does not.
 *
 * Two things decide whether a notice is in the queue at all:
 *
 * * **Where the reader is.** A notice with a `trigger_route` waits for a
 *   matching page and is shown there — in-context help rather than news — and
 *   is skipped everywhere else. Matching happens here because routes are a
 *   client concept; the server just carries the pattern.
 * * **How many times they have acknowledged it.** Dismissals are counted, and
 *   a notice that asked for more than one comes back until it has them.
