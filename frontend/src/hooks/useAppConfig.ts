/**
 * Runtime config fetched once at boot.
 *
 * The backend serves deployment-specific values (like the optional captcha
 * or billing portal) here because Vite vars are baked into the static
 * bundle at build time and can't change between deployments. One image,
 * many envs.
 *
 * Cached hard, but not forever. Most of these only change when the operator
 * restarts the backend with new env vars, at which point a page reload
 * re-fetches. The community directory is the exception: it is a database
 * setting an owner can change while people are using the app, and everyone
 * else's client has to arrive at the same answer.
 *
 * So the owner's own write invalidates this query (immediate for them), and
 * every other client re-checks when it next comes back to the tab or mounts a
 * consumer — at most once per CONFIG_STALE_MS. That is one small request on
 * returning to a tab, against a config that would otherwise stay wrong until
 * the page was reloaded.
