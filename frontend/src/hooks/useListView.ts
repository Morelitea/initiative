/**
 * One person's view of one list: how they show it, and what they narrow it

 * view is the person's own, kept for them on that list as a view preference
 * (so it follows them from one device to the next), under {@link viewKey}.
 *
 * Every list keeps its view here, in one shape:
 *
 * - `layout`: which way they were last looking at it, where it offers several
 *   (a project's list layouts; My Tasks' table or calendar; a queue's list or
 *   on-deck; a gallery's masonry, grid or timeline);
 * - `mode`: a calendar's month, week, day or list;
 * - `parts`: for each layout (one, `LIST`, where there is only one), their
 *   filters, sort, grouping and hidden columns.
 *
 * A list says what its filters are, what someone who set none sees, and what
 * an older release kept for it, which is read until they change something and
 * then kept here. A typed search and a date range are not kept: they are for
 * one visit.
