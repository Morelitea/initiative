/**
 * How an instance of a tool lists what it holds, and shows one of them: its
 * layouts. A project has a table, a board and a calendar, and a task's detail;
 * each is drawn as shipped until it is changed, and is changed on its own. How
 * a person narrows a list, and sorts it, is theirs (their view, kept by
 * {@link useProjectTaskView}), not the layout's.
 *
 * The set carries `can_configure`, computed server-side (the project's owner,
 * the initiative's managers, a community admin). Permission is never derived
 * client-side, and this is the one request that answers it for the tasks page
 * and the settings alike.
