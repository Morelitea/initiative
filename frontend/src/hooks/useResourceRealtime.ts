/**
 * Subscribe to one tool entity's change signal (a queue's or a counter
 * group's) and refetch it and its lists on every change, so React Query reads
 * the latest state through the normal endpoints. A frame names a change and
 * never carries the resource.
 *
 * Built on the shared live socket, so it authenticates in its first frame,
 * reconnects with jittered backoff, and notices a connection that has gone
 * quiet. The credential is read as each first frame is written, so a renewed
 * token does not tear the socket down; a reconnect refetches, since whatever
 * changed while it was away was said to nobody.
