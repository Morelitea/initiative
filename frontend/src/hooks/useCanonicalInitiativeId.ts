/**
 * The initiative an entity page is addressed under.
 *
 * The path is the source of truth while the entity loads — that is what lets a
 * "not found" or "no access" page still offer a back-link. But the entity is
 * the authority once it arrives: an address naming a different initiative is
 * simply wrong, and left alone it would go on generating child, settings and
 * back links into an initiative the entity isn't in.
 *
 * So a disagreement is corrected rather than tolerated — the URL is rewritten
 * in place (no history entry) to the entity's own address, and every caller
 * gets the entity's initiative back.
 *
 * Pass `undefined` while loading. Pass `null` for a genuinely guild-level
 * entity (only calendars have any) — that is an address, not a missing value.
