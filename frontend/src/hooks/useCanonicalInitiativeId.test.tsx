/**
 * Correcting an address the entity disagrees with.
 *
 * The correction builds a destination out of the current location, and the
 * pieces of that location are not all strings: TanStack's `search` is the
 * parsed object and `hash` comes without its "#". Reaching for the wrong one
 * crashed the page it was trying to fix — and only ever on the mismatch path,
 * which is the branch nobody exercises by accident.
