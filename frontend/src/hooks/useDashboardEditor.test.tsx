/**
 * Editing state, and specifically what happens to a draft while a save is in
 * flight.
 *
 * Drags land faster than requests return, so "the save succeeded" and "the
 * draft is still what we saved" are different questions. Conflating them loses
 * whatever the user did in between — silently, since the canvas just snaps back
 * to the server's older arrangement.
 *
 * The fake below *stores* what it is given and the test re-renders with the new
 * dashboard, because that is what the real flow does (mutate → invalidate →
 * refetch). A fake that acknowledged saves without keeping them would make a
 * re-added widget byte-identical to an older save's payload, and the test would
 * then be measuring the fake rather than the hook.
 *
 * The other half is ordering. A save is a whole-definition PATCH, so two in
 * flight can commit in either order and leave the older layout authoritative;
 * the hook keeps one on the wire at a time, and the tests below hold it to
 * that — including the unmount case, where waiting is not available.
