/**
 * Reading the marketplace catalog.
 *
 * The catalog is one shared surface addressed by globally unique ids, and no
 * listing carries a community — but *which* of it a community is offered does depend on
 * the community asking: a dashboard a plug-in ships with itself appears only where the
 * plug-in is installed. So every read here is community-addressed and keyed per community,
 * the shelf and a single listing alike, and the answer a card gives is the
 * answer the page it opens gives.
 *
 * Whether a listing is *installed here* is a separate per-community question the
 * dashboards and plug-ins endpoints answer; the surface merges those in client-side.
