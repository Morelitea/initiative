/**
 * The two halves of this together.
 *
 * The client refetches what has gone stale when a window comes back to the
 * front. That is the point — a tab left in the background has no other way to
 * learn what changed. It is also the moment a form is most likely to be
 * half-written, so the two only make sense as a pair, and nothing else asserts
 * them as one.
