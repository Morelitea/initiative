/**
 * My Messages, as React sees it.
 *
 * The ratchet has to advance in a defined order, so the work itself lives in
 * `@/crypto/messaging` and this file only schedules it. Two things are worth
 * knowing about the shape:
 *
 * * **The local log is the source of truth for a thread.** The server deletes a
 *   message the moment it is collected, so React Query caches what this device
 *   decrypted, not what an endpoint would return.
 * * **Collection is triggered by the socket, not a poll.** A `dm` frame carries
 *   nothing; it says there is something to fetch.
