/**
 * One authenticated WebSocket, kept open.
 *
 * Both push channels — the per-guild events bus and the personal notification
 * stream — need the same connection underneath: authenticate in the first
 * frame, reconnect with backoff, stop for good once the credential has been
 * rejected repeatedly, and notice a socket that has stopped carrying without
 * ever closing. There is no library behind any of that, so it was written
 * twice; this is the one copy.
 *
 * What differs between the two channels sits above it — which address, what
 * else rides in the auth frame, and what a frame means — and that is the whole
