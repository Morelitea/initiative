 * the APIs whose features it registers, and row models are static slots rather
 * than per-instance options. `DataTable` is the single table factory here, so
 * this registry is the union of what any of its callers use.
 *
 * Per-instance behaviour is switched off with the matching `manual*` option
 * instead (see `DataTable`), which is what the row-model pipeline checks.
