/**
 * What a widget receives.
 *
 * A binding names a `source` (§6 of the design); the host resolves it through
 * the ordinary RLS-gated hooks — per viewer, through the six gates — and hands
 * the widget the normalized envelope below. The widget never names an endpoint
 * and never sees a token: by the time it runs, authorization has already
 * happened and it is looking at rows the viewer could have loaded themselves.
 *
 * **There are two envelopes, not nine.** A statement and a spreadsheet range
 * both answer with columns and rows, so both arrive as {@link TabularData} and
 * a widget never learns which it was given. An installed app's data is its own
 * shape, declared in its own manifest, and its widget ships alongside — that is
 * {@link AppRows}, and no built-in widget reads it.
 *
 * **All timestamps are epoch milliseconds, UTC.** The sandbox has a frozen
 * clock and no timezone, deliberately: rendering a timestamp for a human is the
 * renderer's job, not the widget's.
 */

/**
 * What a column holds, in the field registry's own vocabulary.
 *
 * Declared here rather than imported from the generated client, because this
 * file is the sandbox's contract and a widget written against it must not move
 * when a serializer does. `dataShapes.test.ts` holds it equal to the served
 * `FieldType`, so the two say the same words without one importing the other.

 * columns are described rather than assumed, and why a widget declares the
 * shape it can draw instead of the source it can read.
 *
 * Rows are positional against `columns`, not keyed by name, for the reason

 * ships in the same manifest, so the two agree because they were published
 * together. What the proxy does is read the answer through that declaration —
 * the returns holding several become `rows`, read side by side; the ones
 * holding a single value stay whole in `values`, so a total or a reason there
 * is nothing survives an empty set.
 *
 * They are still *data*. The sandbox receives values, and the SceneSpec it has
 * to return has no `html` mark, no raw-string passthrough and no way to name a
