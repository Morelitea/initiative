/**
 * What to offer somebody typing a statement.
 *
 * Deliberately not a parser. The validator is the only thing that reads SQL
 * properly, and a second reading of it here would be a second thing to keep
 * right — so this works on words: what is being typed, and which of the names
 * the server says exist start with it.
 *
 * That is enough because the vocabulary is closed and small. The server serves
 * both halves of it (`/query/vocabulary` and `/fields/{dataset}`), so a name
 * offered here is one the validator accepts, and a dataset or function added
 * there reaches this without an edit.
 *
 * One concession to context: when the text already names datasets, only those
 * datasets' fields are offered. That is a set intersection over words, not a
 * `FROM` clause being read — being wrong about it costs a suggestion, never a
 * statement, because nothing is completed that the author does not choose.
