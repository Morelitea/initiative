/**
 * Sample rows, in the one shape `dataShapes.ts` documents.
 *
 * Ships with the app rather than living beside the tests, because the widget
 * picker previews every widget by *running* it — the same sandbox, validator
 * and renderer a live tile uses, over these rows. So someone choosing a widget
 * sees the real thing before adding it, and the widget tests exercise the same
 * contract the previews do.
 *
 * One sample per *shape*, not per source. A widget draws columns now, so what a
 * preview needs is a set of columns its slots can be filled from — and two
 * widgets that draw the same shape can honestly share one.
 *
 * Frozen values throughout: the sandbox has a frozen clock, so the samples get
 * a frozen calendar and a preview renders identically every time.
