 * - **Something to connect** — no page, but a credential the member or an
 *   admin supplies. Opens a dialog where they do that.
 * - **Neither** — it contributes widgets or data to somewhere else. There is
 *   nothing to open, so it does not take a row of its own.
 *
 * A surface says where it renders; *who* may open it there is the server's
 * answer (`surface_access`), computed by the same decision the handoff mint
 * makes: the placement's roles inside an initiative, the community's admins at
 * the community level and on an `admin_only` surface. Nothing here decides
 * access — this decides what is worth offering, so a reader is not handed a
 * door that would not open.
