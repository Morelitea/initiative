/**
 * Whether this device may lead anyone to a purchase on the web.
 *
 * The web and the desktop app always may. The phone apps follow their store's
 * rules for linking out to a web checkout, which depend on the country of the
 * store account:
 *
 * - iOS: the App Store allows a link to an outside purchase on the US
 *   storefront only.
 * - Android installed from Google Play: Play allows it in the countries listed
 *   below, read from the Play billing country.
 * - Android installed any other way (an APK, Obtainium): Play's rules do not
 *   apply, so it sells as the web does. An install whose installer Android
 *   does not report is treated as a store install.
 *
 * When the store cannot say — an older native build without the method, no
 * storefront, Play billing unavailable, no answer in time — a store install
 * does not sell.
 *
 * Whether a purchase can be made at all is a separate question: a deployment
 * with no billing portal (`billing: null` from `/config`) never sells, whatever
 * this says.
