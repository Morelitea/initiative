 * Derive the calendar bounds and validity for a start/end date pair.
 *
 * Each end bounds the other's calendar, and a bound is only produced when the
 * opposite date is actually set — an unset or unparsable value yields
 * `undefined` rather than an Invalid Date, which would hide every day.
 *
 * A range with only one end set is legitimate everywhere we use this (a task
 * with just a due date, a project with just a start), so it is never inverted.
 * Equal ends are fine too: that is a single-day range. Pickers also accept a
 * typed value, so picking is not the only way a range is entered — forms use
 * `isInverted` to disable their submit and keep it out of the API.
 *
 * Accepts date-only (`2026-03-02`) and date-time (`2026-03-02T15:30`) values;
 * a date-only value resolves to the local calendar day.
