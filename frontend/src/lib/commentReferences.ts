/**
 * What a comment points at.
 *
 * A comment is markdown, and its references are written into the text —
 * `#task[Ship it](12)`, `@[](4)`. A thing's label is what the writer saw when
 * they wrote it, so it is a fallback rather than the answer: what a reader
 * should see is what the thing is called now. A person is stored without one,
 * because their name is only ever read (older text still carries `@[Ada](4)`).
 *
 * This finds them so a whole thread can be resolved in one request, rather than
 * each comment asking for itself.
