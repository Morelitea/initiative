/**
 * How a relation reads to a person, and which edge asserting one writes.
 *
 * The database stores one direction and the API renders every edge from the side
 * that asked, so which way a relation runs is a presentation question — and this
 * is the only place that answers it. A component asks for a group and is told
 * what to call it, what to draw beside it, and what to POST; it never decides
 * that `depends_on` outbound is the blocked end.
 *
 * Two of the six primitives are absent on purpose. `tagged_with` keeps its own
 * tag picker — a label is not something you pick a relationship type for. And
 * `references` is derived: it is read out of a body when that body is saved, so
 * it is shown and never asserted. `SUBTYPES` ships empty server-side, so there
 * is no finer word to choose yet.
