/**
 * A CSS custom property as a colour a WebGL renderer can be handed.
 *
 * The theme states its colours in `oklch()`, which is the right thing for CSS
 * and no use at all to sigma: it reads `#rgb`, `rgb()` and `rgba()`, and
 * anything else comes out black rather than as an error.
 *
 * Converting is not a matter of asking the canvas to restate it — a browser
 * that understands `oklch()` hands `fillStyle` straight back, still in
 * `oklch()`, because it keeps the colour space rather than flattening it. So the
 * colour is actually *painted* and the pixel read back, which is the one way to
 * get sRGB out of a browser whatever went in.
 *
 * Doing it at all means a themed picture follows the theme — including an accent
 * somebody set for their own community — instead of a second set of colours
 * hard-coded beside the first and drifting from it.
