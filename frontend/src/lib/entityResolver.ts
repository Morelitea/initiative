/**
 * Turning a bare entity id into the URL that addresses it.
 *
 * Every tool entity now lives inside its initiative — `/i/{initiative}/{tool}/{id}` —
 * so a link needs the whole chain, not just the id. Most callers already hold
 * the parent and should build the route directly with `lib/tools.ts`. A few
 * genuinely can't: a `@mention` is an id embedded in comment text, a queue
 * item's linked entity is a bare id, and a notification's target path was
 * written to the database before anyone knew where the entity would live.
 *
 * Those go through `/go/{refType}/{id}`, whose loader calls
 * {@link resolveEntityPath} and replaces itself with the real address. It costs
 * one read — on the way to a page that was going to read that entity anyway.
