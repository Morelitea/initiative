/**
 * THE tool registry — the single human-readable place a tool is defined.
 *
 * The canonical tool set is the backend `Tool` enum (mirrored into the
 * generated types). Every derived name follows one rule set, so a tool's
 * entry here is just its icon:
 *
 *   value            "counter_group"          (the enum / resource_type)
 *   plural           "counter_groups"         → permission keys, member flags
 *   kebab plural     "counter-groups"         → route segment, API path
 *   camel plural     "counterGroups"          → i18n namespace, palette group
 *   camel singular   "counterGroup"           → route param name
 *   pascal singular  "CounterGroup"           → nav create-label key
 *
 * ## Adding a tool
 * 1. Backend: add the `Tool` enum member + wire the registries there
 *    (`app/core/tools.py` — its drift tests walk you through the rest).
 * 2. Regenerate types (`pnpm generate:api`).
 * 3. Add ONE entry to `TOOL_ICONS` below.
 * 4. Add the i18n namespace file + nav keys, the route files, and a data
 *    hook — `src/lib/tools.test.ts` fails with a list of exactly what is
 *    missing until every surface exists.
 *
 * There is deliberately NO per-tool capability matrix. Every tool is
 * recentable, taggable, shareable, has a command-palette group, and has a
 * settings page. A tool that genuinely differs is named in ONE exception set
 * below with its reason — the same way `app/core/tools.py` states these facts
 * — so a new tool gets every surface by default and an omission has to be
 * written down to happen.
