/**
 * What a write made stale, described once and matched once.
 *
 * Orval keys queries by URL (e.g. `["/api/v1/tags/"]`), so a domain question
 * ("every task list") is a question about paths. The `q.*` builders answer it
 * as a **description** — a `Spec` naming paths, prefixes and thread ids — and
 * `invalidate()` merges however many of those it is handed and walks the cache
 * ONCE.
 *
 * That single walk is the point. A predicate filter makes React Query test
 * every cached query, so the old shape — one `invalidateQueries` per helper,
 * helpers called once per changed entity — cost a full pass per call. A
 * realtime batch of 300 comments came to 2,104 passes and 367ms of blocked
 * main thread; described and merged, it is one pass and under a millisecond,
 * and the cost stops growing with the size of the batch. Repeats collapse for
 * free: merging is into sets, so one list named by three hundred changes is one
 * entry.
 *
 * There are TWO disjoint families of keys, and a match MUST NOT cross between
 * them:
 *
 *  - COMMUNITY-scoped keys live under `/api/v1/c/{communityId}/...`. `communityExact` and
 *    `communityPrefix` reach these and ONLY for the ACTIVE community — never another
 *    community, and never a non-community key. This is the tenancy boundary: a mutation
 *    in one community can't touch another community's (or a personal) cached data.
 *  - PERSONAL / platform keys are everything else (`/api/v1/me/*`, `/settings`,
 *    `/users`, `/communities`, `/operator`, `/notifications`, `/version`, `/recents`).
 *    `personalExact` and `personalPrefix` reach these and ONLY these.
 *
 * A few resources genuinely span both (a community list plus its cross-community `/me`
 * aggregate; platform + community AI settings). Those name a bucket from each
 * family in one `Spec` — still two boundary-respecting tests, decided in one
 * place rather than blurred into one path test. The whole rule now lives in
 * `matches()` below, the only code in the app that decides whether a cached key
 * belongs to the current community.

// ── Community Switch ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

/**
 * Drop the departing community's cached data on a community switch.
 *
 * Only keys that address a community (`/api/v1/c/{communityId}/…`) are reset, and not
 * the arriving community's own: those hold its data, not the departing community's.
 * Online that changes nothing observable — they are stale on mount and refetch
 * anyway — but it is the difference between a cached page and an empty one
 * when the device has no connection to refetch from.
 *
 * Everything else survives. A platform or personal path (`/me/*`, `/users`,
 * `/communities`, `/recents`) answers the same in every community, and a
 * hand-written key that holds community data (`["query", communityId, …]`) carries the
 * community's id, so another community's entry is never the one read.

 * only the copy on screen catching up.
 *
 * Three shapes hold a post, and the board is the one that is easy to miss: it
 * scrolls rather than pages, so its cache is an infinite query's
 * `{ pages: [...] }` rather than a single page of items. Patching only the
 * other two would leave every optimistic update invisible on the surface it
